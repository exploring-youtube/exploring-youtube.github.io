jqtccOoMOKU,I think there were too many unnecessary things.. how does 3 monitors help with eye problems? No more leg space. she wont be doing makeup for 8 hrs at work so make up table is not an efficient use of the space,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

jqtccOoMOKU,This should be a series.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,So destinee did nothing. And this was ridiculously over the top and pointless. The other time when Kane give kristens desk a makeover was so much better and nice. This was nowhere near as good. None of this makeover stuff was necessary  a dj desk in the office and she gets double desk space and an extra monitor she doesn't use  and wigs permanently there  really  how is that an improvement? :(,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,This isn't as funny if you never watched pimp my ride,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

jqtccOoMOKU,this was so extra lmaooo,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,It's supposed to be for work. Not at home. I would hate that. Just organize and reduce the amount of space that gets taken up. It's too just busy and distracting for a work environment. You shouldn't need a VANITY at work. Come prepared or get ready in the bathroom. I feel this would make the work ethic of her and others around her suffer.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,My moms name is destinee,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,They didn't actually renovate her desk they just made a new one because why would they put it in that white room,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jqtccOoMOKU,create a series please,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,You have no idea how good you have it. You know what SJWs say about being blind to your own privilege? I actually agree with them in this case.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Yessssssss girl,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Stop hating everything she said is true.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Everyone here in the comments section saying it's 'sexist' or its 'man-hating' the video was talking about equality and not one gender fighting another. If you are a male and you're complaining that this video isn't about you start being a little less selfish speak out about equal rights and if something like a problem she mentioned in the video ever happens to you then I would never hate on you or discriminate against that. So learn to appreciate the truth and the art and stop spewing hate behind your computer screens.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Yup,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,TBH not Every man is like that and lots of girls decide to go that way but lots decide to be their own independent self so it's really your choice you make.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,slay,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Why did l watch this...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,The truth about being a girl is  being a girl.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,It breaks my heart as well because women are just judged and used most of the time and they can't be who they are any more. Being afraid of the night and being alone hurts.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,You slayed them boys  GURL!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,great video!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,I have identified your problems. You think you are a 15 year old girl and want guys who can be on Jersey shore to date you. Also  you are not familiar with the laws of country you  live in. You fix those 3 things and you'll find out what it's like to be a woman so you can act your age.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,You know what pls dont hate me for this but....some boys are eeally jerks ok pls dont hate me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,"the truth" about being you  not being a girl. get over your own issues before talking about someone's opinion or whatever someone else said.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,The thing about women in the same job as a man being paid less is a myth,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Thank you for making this video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,This was really inspiring and it goes to show that women in this generation right now are dealing with social and inner problems.  The feeling of not being perfect while needing the succeed academically and proving to everyone else that you aren't worth less because your a woman  but the fact that you are worth more than you think.  If anything  in relationships  this might not be true  but this is my point of view  I believe that women have the most to lose.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Wow... so true... so beautiful,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,What about the men?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Who read the title and went. Straight to the comments,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Y'all not oppressed,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Natural selection,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Many people can say that this video is really bad and not true but now we are today and our society is becoming like that. I everyday have to act happy and nod for everything when truly I'm not. We woman/girls are being picked on bullied etc. I feel like this video is very strong. Many people can argue saying that boys don't like girls because of boobs  butt  or waist yes it's true not every boy but  like one out of 20 don't care about them the rest do. I feel like people should stop and think and put yourself on our perspective how we feel even some boys too.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,It's all over with these crybaby modern women lets just recreate them in a lab  we have the technology since they come from our sperm  we can all have fembots.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,What a thot,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,What about men,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,as a 12 year old girl  this video inspired me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,This may be my favorite video of May 2018.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,What? I couldn't focus  her hands were moving too much and her voice was more fake than patriarchy.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,thanks  for those who got it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

zZM57oTu9Ng,1:47 wage gap is a myth,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Where can I find this whole video typed out? (As a speech) This is beautiful and speaks the truth. I love it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,This is true feminism. What you see on the media outlets is extreme feminazis that have nothing better to do than to burn bras and run around naked. Feminism is the idea that woman should be equal to men - and we should be. Women should not be repressed because of their body  skin tone  weight or religion.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,On National Women's Day last month  I heard a group of boys complaining. Complaining that men don't get a day dedicated to them  because they work SOO hard. I turned around and said  "  Quit complaining. Do you know how much a girl needs to deal with?" Then they started a huge fight because men should be equal to women and how they have it easier. Good times Eh?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,preach thats all i have to say,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,We have lived in a male oriented society for HUNDREDS of years and it's about time things changed. Haters can hate all they want  but there's no stopping this movement.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,The scariest thing about being a girl is the constant fear while walking alone. Even if nothing/no one is there  it's just an instinct to be scared based on what society says to be afriad of .,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
zZM57oTu9Ng,Really powerful message!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

MmlVBuxVNLA,It really sucks that I grew up in a very "redneck" area so most of the juggalos I knew were actually racist  non-accepting people.  It's good to find out that they aren't all like that though :).,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,HoNk :o),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,so... any homestucks?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,Not a fan of icp personally but I think juggalos get a bad wrap for no reason they're just fans enjoying music.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,Do they help the world,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,Hey what are there purpose in life???,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,... the juggalos are still a thing? *Bruh are you serious*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,Thank you so much for this great video! I'm not a juggalo  but I'm part of the furry fandom and as you briefly mentioned  there's also tons uf mocking and misconceptions around us  - but what's important is that - drama and some cringe aside - these sub-cultures can be family. <3,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
MmlVBuxVNLA,Lmaoo saw a tweet that said when people start naming random colors to show that they aren't racist  they're racist  and it is damn applicable here.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

MmlVBuxVNLA,Yo homestuck fans out there you better know who these people are.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

MmlVBuxVNLA,I actually liked a couple of icp songs growing up but never like bought an album  gone to a show etc  basically was never a hard-core fan.   I respect what they do for their juggalo community  it's incredible the kind of fan base they've managed to build over the years. They seem like a couple of real sweet guys too.  I'd heard a little about juggalos but not a lot  this video definitely taught me a lot about them I didn't know.   And honestly the shows look fun  I'm down with some of their music and not too afraid of clowns so maybe I should go to a show some time :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

fLGu4hvpBF0,You have to question some of the origina of the laws..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,To be fair  the Alaskan life vests thing sounds pretty reasonable  along with the Kentucky ban on dying animals (it might hurt them  keep them safe!),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Buy papa Murphy's stock instead of the video because frsh is worth buying at 200 instead of the video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,In Denmark if the Baltic sea frezzes up and the swedes run over to fight  you have a right to poke them aggressively with a stick. Not a big branch or anything  a. stick.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Who uses a refrigerator as a dog house anyway?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,DONT'T TOUCH MY BEEEEEEEES.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,N.  Nn,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,The next Purge movie should be about a cross-country road trip where the protagonists try to break as many of these laws as possible.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,I live in Arizona and how is the law weird,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,okay but the clips made this video unnecessarily long like if they weren't there the video would've only been half as long,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,you americans..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Im #17 and i never knew this,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Do you mean venomous snake?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Florida's law mandating theatre doors open only outward is not weird or strange. In fact  it is perfectly sensible  and a part of building codes not only nationwide  but worldwide.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Texas - that seems reasonable actually,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Some of these aren't even weird though...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Guess I can't interfere with a Carrier Pigeon,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,I got to Maryland,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,If you go to Virginia Beach they'll fine you like $10 for cussing,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,1:24 Florida*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Fort Madison: The fire department is required to practice fire fighting for fifteen minutes before attending a fire.  Alaska: Men must NEVER be completely naked.  Arizona: One may not have more than two dildos in a house.  Arkansas: Oral sex is considered as sodomy.  California: Women may not wear high heels within the city limits. - LA: A man must require a license before serenading a woman - SF: It is illegal to beat a rug in front of a house - Long Beach: It is illegal to curse on a mini-golf course - Walnut: Children may not wear a Halloween mask unless given a special permit from the sheriff  Colorado: It is illegal for a woman wearing a red dress to be out on the streets after seven p.m.  South Dakota: If three or more Indians are walking down the street together  they may be considered a war party and fired upon.  Florida: It is considered an offense to take a shower naked.  Minnesota: In Rochester  all bathing suits must be inspected by the head of police   seriously... I remember a law where it is prohibited to rescue people from a burning fire unless properly dressed in a nightgown. US-states  you seriously need to review your hopelessly outdated laws!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,you guys stole this video idea. someone else uploaded this like last week,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Man's law doesn't exist. Only natural law exists. What is a natural right? Action that doesn't cause (initiate) harm to someone. American revolution was about fighting to not live as a slave: "Give me liberty or give me death" - Patrick Henry. We are here to know the difference between right and wrong behavior and create freedom on this earth. Self defense is also a right to put down an attack. Please go teach natural rights and spread the message so your kids grand kids don't wake up in a total communist country with total thug police and military and government worshiping sheep disarmed population. Don't fall for any propaganda.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Some of these are normal,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

fLGu4hvpBF0,5:30 Ok  do people do this?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,flordia..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,damnit i need to get rid of my snake then,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,Utah tho we are not monkeys XD,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fLGu4hvpBF0,I live in Minnesota and I'm not really sure why one would want to try and catch a greasy pig.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

XmFZnMLkG_k,THIS IS WHY MY BROTHER IS SO GOOD AT DRAWING!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Im a dog :o,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Meh I'm a damn pig I already knew it..Meh.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,AYYYY THIS YEAR IS MY HOROSCOPE,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I will find that my goals are met with resistance,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,There were actually thirteen animals in the legend  the last one being the cat  but it fell in the river which is why we have twelve,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,This has Eugene's directing written all over it,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Im a monkey,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,OMIGOD THIS IS TRUE i do my career as a gymnast and I Was zooming up the ladder fatser than the other years this year but I started loosing money ;-;,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Im a dog 2018 this year yay,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I appreciate how adorable the design for the Pig zodiac was.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,This video is amazing wow,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Wait....my mom say that my cousin is a rat.....she was born on 2009.......OH SHOOT......,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Where are my monkeys?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,i cant find any goats in these comments  seriously guys where are you,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,"Be cautious in 2018. Expect unfortunate events to happen in threes" Well  that's comforting. Now I'm scared to get out of the house....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,i already know im dog cuz i am chinese and british maybe a little japanese,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Pig...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Those outfits are perfection.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I'm a frickin- wait wHATT DID U SAY A GOD DAMN PIG,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Are you trying to use traditional chinese clothing or?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Losing a loved ONE!?!?!?!?!? oh hell nah this gave me more anxiety than anything,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I don't know who Leena Nguyen is but daaaaamn she deserves some more attention for producing this video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,i'm pisces  i don't know which one i would be in chinese astronomy,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Uhhhhh I feel like this is an over-exotification of Chinese culture. The Western world has a nasty habit of seeing East Asia as novelty and mystical purely for their own entertainment and not looking out for the well-being of East Asians. While I acknowledge that these costumes are extremely well designed and are very creative  I feel like they are drawing more from stereotypes that Westerners have about China than from actual traditional Chinese clothing. If BuzzFeed is going to brand itself as a company that is hyper aware of social justice and racial issues  they need to do a better job than creating content that's borderline cultural appropriation like this video is.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,My Snake prediction has been so true so far.  Like  7 people I know have died this year so far  and stress and grades have been making me sick  but at the same time I'm meeting and achieving so many things.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,where tf sheep at,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Who else is a pig?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,oh no im going to have deep romantic trouble...     jk lololol im single af that was funny,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Mine is a dog and my zodiac sign is an Aquarius,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I wonder how many people in the comments think they're the animal the video says but they're really not... If you're born in January or February double check on another website guys,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,You need to be more accurate on the years  also it slightly triggers me they did Goat instead of Sheep. The years  you could be born in January or even February of a year and be different to the animal they said in this video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I'm a pig and Scorpio. wtf...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Not much about monkey huh,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,What song is this? :(,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Prediction are soo true but why bad luck still this year. I am done with my life seeing it or beliving it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,WHAT AM I?! I WAS BORN IN 2007 COME ON,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Not all born in that year is that animal  For example you are born in Jan 2004 you are sheep and not a monkey,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,That rabbit tho,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,These are totally biased and negative.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Oh my god for monkey it said   "In 2018   Monkeys may see plans go awry or their trust in others broken." If this isn't true idk what is,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,WHERE MY DRAGONS AT??,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,you guys should do this again but with Astrological signs,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,rabbit was sexy asl,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Whos a dog with me?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I hate taking showers and when my mom tells me I compare myself as a dog,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,For those who are rat and a virgo like me  we need to be careful this year in both signs we will have problems coming to us.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,This was honestly beautiful,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,These were all very cool-- but why were some of them so sexualized?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,3:01 pretty sure that roosters are male,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,I'm the pig,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
XmFZnMLkG_k,Omg you girls slayin de game,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Zw7sxJjgBLQ,So "Seltzer" is just a fancy name for sparkling (carbonated) water? I always thought it was some luxury special water because of the weird name  but it seems it is the same as what we here in Germany drink every day and what you can buy at Aldi as a 6x1.5 litre pack for 1 Euro as a store-brand water.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
Zw7sxJjgBLQ,"Je suis un pamplemousse" is French for i am a grapefruit.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Zw7sxJjgBLQ,Kroger brand is my fave. Bubbles last the longest,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
Zw7sxJjgBLQ,'je suis un pamplemousse' is said in English as 'I am a grapefruit'.... They should have wrote 'Ceci est un pamplemousse (this is a grapefruit)' It would've made more sens...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

qvAEXKmxWgY,Why was there only black people in this video? Do they not know that pretty much everybody has cookouts  or are cookouts just a "black thing" now? Caucasian in Detroit  you don't even understand how often we have cookouts.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,I love how he they cut the whole part about Kanye West out but they put him in the thumbnail for views lmfao,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,It's true that racism towards white people has less "real-life" consequences than if the reverse were to happen. But Buzzfeed selling the rhetoric that some forms of racism are tolerable  annoys the f outta me and I'm not even white.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,AMERICAN black people feel like they are the coolest people in the world bruuh  PS : I'm a non-american black,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

qvAEXKmxWgY,Um no,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Sounds like a racist cult cook out.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,I would never dispute the fact that black people had dreads and corn-rows in their culture  because obviously they did  but so did Scandanavians and Native Americans. It was manageable and good for unwashed hair. Dreads and corn-rows are not exclusive to African Americans  though I concede their popularity is definitely influenced by Black celebs,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,I would invite the following: Rihanna  Beyonce  Zoe Saldana  Hailee Berry  Cardi  Ariana Grande  Tom Holland  Brad pitt  Angelina Jolie  Drake  Buzzfeed clan haha  Zendaya  Miley cyrus.. Honestly this goes on. But like these all cool. Like or show me ur list :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

qvAEXKmxWgY,Can black people be racist to white people? (I want to know your opinion),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Carne Asada for Hispanic communities and Cookout for black communities but it virtually the same thing but different food  good food  but different. I can't imagine having one all together cause it will be crazy af. Is there a different name for other cultures that do this? Also Bruno is the only one invited to mine too haha,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,What is this video? Bharosa isn't invited because she works with Trump? Miley isn't invited because she had corn rows? Gtfo of here with this trash Buzzfeed. Quit making everything about race,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Blackity black black?  Discuss,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Why does every one  hate Trump? Liberals are just a bunch of cry babies.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,"We know he ain't invited" Please send help.  I can't breathe XD,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Kanye is at a state where he just needs love from the black community because clearly he needs to talk to black people. So he's invited so all the aunties and old people can slap him upside the head and then hug him.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,this is so biased lmao,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,I would let Omarosa come just because I liked her on Celebrity Big Brother  I'm not ashamed.....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,PARAMORE CAN COME TO THE COOKOUT HAHAHAH YES,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,A cookout is for all races whether you are black  white  asian  hispanic. Let's stop labeling things and just say it is something for all humans.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,What is Sequoia's Insta?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,So they just a bunch of close minded people who only will select someone who has the exact views as them and they can't be white,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Aussies have cookouts all the time  except they call them barbecues. Isn't that the same thing? Why is cooking and eating outside only for black people?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Of course the most liberal place wouldn't talk about Kanye anymore,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,@Buzzfeed from a public relations standpoint I think you should delete this video....I can see this turning into a PR crisis situation. Just saying.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,A good Haitian sis!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,3:00 you  i like you.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,Click bait,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,They look like they serve up burnt hot dogs and soggy buns at their cookout,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,BuzzFeed once again shoving cultural appropriation down peoples throats. Its ridiculous people. No one is taking anything from a culture. You just want to get angry about little tiny things,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,What is this..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,i'd Invite Trump and Kanye,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,STFU Kanye  doing great,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,black people love paramore lmao,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
qvAEXKmxWgY,I'm tired of this hair stuff where it's appropriating. If somebody is not black and has cornrows then they're appropriating but if you're black and you're wearing a weave from Asian countries or wherever aren't you also appropriating. If you dye your hair blonde is that not appropriating unless you're a mixed African-American who naturally gets blonde hair. And what if you are a mixed African American can I only wear cornrows on half of my head? We are a Melting Pot we're going to take things that we like from one another. That Rachel chick was appropriating she was straight up saying she was African-American and she is not by any means.  I think they should ask about some more celebrities because it seems like you have to look a certain way just to go to a cookout and that's not like any cookout that my family's ever thrown. If we start saying hairstyles are appropriating and then we're going to start going onto food and drinks next. So somebody is going to tell you I know you're not Japanese you can't eat  Sushi and you're not Italian no pizza for you. As long as people are not trying to act like they invented it I don't give damn how you wear your hair or what you eat. Let me bring  this statement up too this chick doesn't want them to come because they might put peas in potato salad?!? Isn't that racist!?!  Let's be classier.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

qvAEXKmxWgY,I don't understand why a cookout is a 'black' thing :\ all cultures have had cookouts since the beginning time and still do.  Are people of other color not allowed to be in cookouts or hold cookouts? And why is everything 'appropriating' and not just someone enjoying what they enjoy.  The entire world is made of intertwining races and cultures why do things have to be different here?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

smnArkZ6eqw,Theyre all pretty easy dogs to train... Unfortunately not all of us get the use of an assistant dog and have to train our own. I am training a 6yo terrier... He needs retrained then we need to spend the 2 years of training for assistance... So because the public think its okaii to allow their dogs and small unattended children in my dogs face im behind nearly an entire year  so another year of training before i can even think about getting a job or being able to do what i want qhen i want. Ive also had an actual charity trainer let his blind dog in training near my dog and he doesnt train them correctly. Theyre not well behaved  they jump and lunge and are old enough to be a calm dog if trained correctly. This worries me as i am not in the position some people are who desperately need the help and yet the dog is disturbing my dog... Thats not right at all. Even though we are in training we are not allowed to wear anything that may suggest we have an assistance dog in training until they have the go ahead from the correct authorities. So please do not just come up to a dog  some of them might be working or in training and please please control your children!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Looking forward to watching this!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

_s-5na27Ak4,its honest and if you think its humble i dont want to be your friend,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,imho in my honest opinion  just think about it do you want somones honest opinion or their "humble" opinion,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

_s-5na27Ak4,100% of 18-21 year olds have a phone? I don't flip dippin think so. That chick from Columbia forgets all of the 18-21 year olds in developing countries  or in poverty  or who are homeless. There is no physical way that 100% of 18-21 year olds have phones.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,It's honest!!!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,These two work well together! I wish y'all would do more videos with them two together!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,Honest. Sure you can say old people say humble instead of honest  but are old people the ones who create commonly used acronyms?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,Am I the only person that thought this was the Myers-Briggs test score?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I feel bad for the guy who was asleep like if you agree,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,HONEST.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I'm 15 and I thought it was humble. Even though most of the younger generation said honest,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I am just tired of acronyms. In the not so far future we are probably going to have to take acronym 101. It's ridiculous.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I'm pretty sure the phrase is in my humble opinion. If you're saying in my honest opinion  it is probably because it is people not knowing what people meant with IMHO  thinking that H meant honest  and taking that mistake and running with it. And now because of the ubiquity of the mistaken phrase  language is mutating.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,Have never heard of anybody thinking it's humble. I was confused what there was to debate. Saying humble makes you sound like an arse because usually when people say they're humble  they think they're the opposite,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,IMO- in my opinion.  TBH- To be honest. I'll stick with those.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I'm so concerned though because I'm 16 and I never knew anyone said "honest." I think it may also have something to do with region.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,it was Humble  then some people define it Honest.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,I'm 18 and I say humble....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,IMHOE   Yes you are,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,It's honest because someone can ask you to speak honestly  or for your honest opinion because a lot of the time people will just say what they think someone wants to hear.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

_s-5na27Ak4,Haven't watched the whole video yet  but IMHO  the answer is simple. It's BOTH. Just a matter of your age/generation. I'm 20  and I use honest  because I don't hear humble very often  but I hear honest a lot. Back then  humble was probably used more often  therefore the word humble is used,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

_s-5na27Ak4,i thought it was in my holy opinion,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,In My HONEST opinion  we win! Because we win!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,It's "humble". My native language is not English and "abbreviations" is a topic in our English lessons and we have always been taught that this abbreviation means "In my humble opinion". I think younger people tend to say "honest" because they don't even know the word "humble" and they had to come up with something simple so they say it's "honest".,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
_s-5na27Ak4,Are we changing TTFN now too??  How many more internet/chat room/message board abbreviations are we gonna change because the newer generation doesn't know what they originally meant?  Ignorance of a meaning and changing a word because you didn't know the original meaning isn't a valid argument for the evolution of a language.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

fsyA4PCW9ds,Nike's are all about marketing. They are not comfortable at all! Try other brands and they have so much more padding inside. I don't understand why so many people buy them  except for that they want to look "cool." My feet are more important than that!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,I own literally one pair of shoes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,I see hot beard guy  I click.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,From where I am for 1300$  216 people could get a pair of shoes.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,Every single pair of shoes in my closet are under 10 dollars.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,1:58 *no way*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,these are all disgusting,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,i knew abt all of those shoes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,I usually always go for the most minimalist shoe I can find  but made of quality materials.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,clicked cos i saw red bottoms lmFaooO,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,I would spent $20 for an everyday shoe. $50 if its for a special event. But I don't think I could bring myself to wear $1000 shoes in my house  let alone out and about.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,So many shoes look horrible but are expensive af.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,the last quote tho  he's 100 % right!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,i can't believe none of these men follow hypebeast,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,If you sit on your own voodoo doll will you ever be able to stand up again?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,roshes arent barefoot runners,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,Man  Kevin's buttons are well labeled and easy to push. Also  the ugliest sneakers in the video were the most expensive. Not surprising.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
fsyA4PCW9ds,my guesses 75 865 560 1300,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,it wouldve been so cool and fun if he would have bumped into casey on a run,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,10 miles a day is good. But you got eat clean and maintain to keep it up. I run 4 miles a day. But I got do weights too. 10 just too taxing on legs plus squats.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Amazing vid,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,I wonder how much weight he lost during that week running 10 miles a day,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Gotta love the research person  I mean he logs most of it on Strava... That would have saved some time.  Great achievement though 10 miles a day is intense  I do 7 mile cycling a day.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,intensity thats the answer,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,Casey is my biggest inspiration tbh  big ups for this video!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Anybody else was thinking that while running he will bump in too CaseyNeistat ?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,My brothers name is casey,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,I'm struggling with eating disorders. My life is way too difficult for me. BuzzFeed  sorry for posting this here but I just don't know what to do to overcome this terrible situation :( Can anyone help me?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Can someone find his Instagram,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,For every like I get I will do one push-up.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,i get out of breathe walking up my stairs,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Buzzfeed you realise Casey posts his running details (time/distance) on Strava when he runs.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,Ten miles is a lot when running :D Reminded me to start running again.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,If I got payed to run 10 miles a day and it afforded my lifestyle I would EASILY do it too,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,couldn't you have just checked his Strava?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,is this dude homosexual?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Props to you for running all those miles!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,song  1:03,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Dang his time was impressive too. He was averaging 9/10 minute miles for 10 miles 5 days straight. Super brutal,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,i run everyday and you need to start at your own bodys limits. so just start slow and work up(but still run everyday) to those 10 miles and then you will get the pase and never be able to stop,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Yes the Casey edits too! Nice video omg,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Or they could have just gone on strava and found out his exact average distance. Amateur hour like usual at the Buzzfeed office.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Yo  that low key mall grip,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,You give me motivation,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,This dude barely broke a sweat.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Guys I don't want to be negative but running this much everyday could lead to permanent ligament damage.   Yes running is very good but do too much and you get diminishing results.  All in all  run! Just don't over do it,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Am I the only one who thinks buzzfeed is kinda giving their workers a lil more freedom with their videos ?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Y'all didn't have to watch all his vids you could've just checked his Strava lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,I dislike the guy,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Or you could have just checked his Strava account...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,The difference is  this probably took you all day to run the 10 miles.  Casey does it every morning before an entire work day.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Or like me? I run 10miles everyday too.. Couldnt you have put my name in the title?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Yo ur wierd,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,She could have just looked at his Strava log to get an average,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,This guy kinda look like the singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

903QDFbbeww,definitely one of the best BuzzFeed videos I have seen,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
903QDFbbeww,Is the whole point of the video just copying Casey Neistat? Because this vid seems pointless. I mean  he could have at least discussed some of the merits/demerits of running 10 miles per day.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

I mean  it's not a good thing to pee in a parking lot  especially not outside of a church in a Christian country. But where I'm from it's not legal to throw someone in jail before court.  *Innocent until the contrary is proven.*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

aEBJblFa6f0,okay but zach got drunk off one beer... put eugene in that thing... for science.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
aEBJblFa6f0,I'm totally face palming here   HE GOT SOME IN HIS MOUTH!!!  It doesn't matter that he didn't swallow.  There is a reason that police in Australia ask you if you have just had a drink before they breath test you.  The alcohol residue in your mouth can produce a higher reading than what is in your blood.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
aEBJblFa6f0,Oh look at kieth,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
aEBJblFa6f0,Where did the try guys goooooooooo please come back I miss them!!!! They are my favorite part about buzzfeed!!! I miss all the try guys please come backkk,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
aEBJblFa6f0,The champagne that was poured in your mouth could be making the machine go off and read higher than what it really is. When I use mine  if I don't wash my mouth out  then it reads higher than what I actually am. This is a cool idea though. Watch out frat parties I'm coming with a kiddie pool next time,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SMFWMWDgai4,how do you even get a restaurant at 19 years old? that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to do. also how arrogant do you have to be to charge 155$ for your food at 19 years old? usually the people to do that have decades of professional experience....and they got there bc they were humble when they were 19 and tried to learn as much as they could instead of opening a restaurant with what i assume is his parents money. if this chef paid for the restaurant himself  he's got my respect but i highly doubt he did.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

cQ54GDm1eL0,This is an amusing video  with a vital message. But it's worth mentioning that our "trusted" news sources are not infallible either. The Iraq War was built on a strong foundation of lies and deceit  with CNN and MSNBC parroting those lies at face value. The sad truth is  nobody who claims to be a journalist should ever be trusted completely. We must think critically about every "fact" we are told. It's the only real way to see the truth.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

2ZR_vMU8db8,That guy want to be french so bad lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,Indian woman is upset she doesnt have colonialist DNA in her. Apparently its not cool to be a brown eyes black hair brown skinned pure Indian now.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,Who tf would want to be French so badly?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,all these pale faced gooks are caucasian babies  the original asians were dark skinned,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,For Aria  Laos is not a race-based nation  it's an ethnic-based. Even their language is derived from Thai. So part of the center of Southeast Asia is basically Thai. This also applied to Cambodia and Myanmar. And actually  ancestrally  most of Thais have a little bit of Chinese descent in them. So yeah  not shocking at all.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,My sister and I did a similar video! It'd be great if anyone checked it out :) xx,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,As a Chinese-American  I took the Ancestry + Health test by 23andMe and it offers a lot of insights. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in genealogy  or are looking to find out whether you carry variants for certain genetic diseases. :3,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,The Chinese-scottish guy and the Japanese-British gal could be taken for my couisins. I am Mexican-American.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

2ZR_vMU8db8,You like potstickers more than Gene XD,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,Thai as Thailand not Taiwan,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,The question about where people sometimes get your ethnicity wrong  most of their answers weren't too bad. I'm half Vietnamese and Half English and loads of people think I'm hispanic or latino...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,They are surprised you are Japanese because you are so damn FAT.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,The Lao guy isn't Thai  it's just that as far as DNA banks are concerned  there is no Lao  they just have Thai samples. The same way they can't differentiate French from German  they can't differentiate Thai from Lao.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,Why aria did not have any lao mix?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,Two dudes here speaks Cantonese  Every time I see people speak the same language as me I get happy,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,3:27 Ikr. Ify. I'm Filipino. My entire family is pale and I'm the only tan person.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,What the lady is not explaining is that in the case of the people who had Native American is that Northern Asian (Siberia etc) can be misidentified as Native American because that is where they originated and the reference for the original population may be low. It is also very common for people from Britain and Ireland to have German  Scandinavian genetic markers etc because of conquest and that DNA becoming part of that genome. Most European populations are very intermixed and genetically are not that different from eachother. It doesnt mean they necessarily have direct or recent ancestors from that location.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,I'm probably not from earth... Imagine Clark Kent doing a DNA test...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

2ZR_vMU8db8,i'm sorry  but does the Vietnamese guy not understand that if we were French  it's only because the French went into Vietnam  contributed to the destruction of their land and then mated with someone there?? It's not that exotic. It's pretty brutal.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,I noticed none of them said they were proud to be Americans.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

2ZR_vMU8db8,Why is that girl ashamed of being Indian? You look totally Indian for one. For two India has a great culture and traditions  why else would these white people try to conquer us all the time?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,This is not scientific. If you want to talk about the percentage of DNA. Then u need to find the 100% DNA of the regions. U just cannot determine a 100% DNA. The number given in the video is just a reference. For example there are 56 different nations in mainland China. How do you know who's 100% Han nation?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,the underlying fear is "AM I ADOPTED  MOTHER? FATHER?",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
2ZR_vMU8db8,It looks like that Americans care too much about DNA ancestors. Here in Brazil I've never heard  "I'm 50% something  25% something and 25% something". Even when both parents are from another country  people just say "I'm Brazilian".,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

qjTu_8hklUw,The thing is  you can actually visit North Korea through Beijing  China. (China and North Korea are partnered together cause if North Korea's society fails  China wouldn't be able to handle the extra population that will come because of it  since they don't know how many people there are in North Korea.) The thing is  no photography and everyone's breathing down your neck  and monitoring you every minute.   Fun Fact: You may or may not be imprisoned if you do something to trigger them.  Fun Fact #2: There are a few rebellious people that take photos anyway  and there are real pictures online you can see of the nation.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,Totally unrelated to Beyonce  Jay or any elevator; I would treat Sam so good if he was my man,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,i'm sorry for saying this i don't mean it but is that a guy? at 1:38,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,If someone can cheat on Beyonce...then ladies... We have no hope.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Lot of speculation going on in this one. Pay close attention to some things: Jay-Z admits he's cheated on her MULTIPLE times  so this is not new. She didn't JUST find out about this. She chose to keep it secret until she couldn't. SUSPECT. Also   where are all the women this man has cheated with? Either he's the BEST male specimen alive and knows how to pick the most loyal quiet side chick's EVER  or he's still paying them or they signed a NDF. Hell  even the president couldn't keep his side chick THAT quiet?! SUSPECT.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,2:08 I don't know if she identifies as a she but she's gorgeous!!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,The lemonade album was based on an African goddess oshun,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Moral of the story  don't go out with this guy in the blue baseball cap.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,May I also point out the significance of "4"? Beyonce was born on 9/4/81  JayZ was born on 12/4/69 and they married on 4/4/2008. 4  4 and 4 become 4:44.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Are we really still talking about this?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,ok why is now no one talking about the lady with a MAN'S voice,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,no thats tyler oakley,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Buzz feed unsolve who?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,If someone be cheating on someone like Beyonce then none of us is safe,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Dude nah he broke the relationship emotionally the moment that happened it became a business relationship,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,How does someone cheat on Beyonce?... If her husband cheated on her  then what could happen to the rest of us...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Answer this question: Why is the whole of America obsessed with overrating Beyonka?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,The guy in the browny orange hoodie... Completely not needed,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,I can appreciate the actual research that went into this whole video. Not a Beyhive fan  however applaud the effort that went into this.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,I'm not liking this new culture of celebrity women forgiving the men who cheated on them. Beyonce  Cardi B  Khloe. Strong women dont need a man and I genuinely thought they were strong. However  maybe they stay with their man because they have kids with them and ideally kids need fathers.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,2:45 what do you mean?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,I don't care what anyone says  Solange is the damn G.O.A.T! Sis beat 3 dope albums out of that elevator!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,I hope you guys do more videos like these and that Britney spears one. you could call it pop culture history or something like that. Idk but i hope you guys continue!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Honestly... Solange is a real one. We all need a Solange in our lives.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Andrea with that fan is killing me lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

g98aYJquPeE,BEYONCE? CHEATED ON BEYONCE? BEYONCE? ARE YOU SERIOUS-,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,These people are literally so beautiful wtf???,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Never really said why Beyonce forgave Jay,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,With everything going on in America alone  THIS is what you decide to decifer?!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Well that's 9 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,I'm over here just feeling bad for Rachel Rey getting caught in the crossfire. She's just trying to live her best life and make hamburgers.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,HE MUST BEEN OUTTA HIS MIND TO CHEAT ON HER,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Why do people stay with those who are cheatin' on them behind their back?  I am sure there are some very nice gentlemen out there for Beyonce.  She doesn't have to settle.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Your timeline is wrong. This started a long time ago.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,"on your own" i dunno,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,dude on the left lookin like logic,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Because they are husband an wife they are willing to make marriage work because she could have walked away keep family out your marriage !!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Solange really do look like her sister in disguise,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Or she wanted to break the cycle of broken marriages in her family and wanted to at least try therapy for their childrens sake and hers,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
g98aYJquPeE,Not really sure why Andrea didn't want to call it an "attack" - I think her concern was perhaps that Solange was being pigeon-holed as the Angry Black Woman (TM) acting out  which is legitimate (as it was labelled as such in some quarters)  but it was technically an attack. The key thing was it was a relatively justifiable one  considering Jay had cheated on her sister.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,we did more community service than partying  granted we did have epic parties.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,idk why im watching this i could care less about greek life,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,uybuy,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I swear this isn't meant to be disrespectful  but how can  you be gender non-conformist yet still define yourself as a woman?  Isn't that a gender? Again I'm not trying to be disrespectful  I just need more education on this. Does that just mean that she's a woman but doesn't necessarily conform to what society thinks that means? Because I'd consider that to simply be a personality trait. Like I'm a woman  but I don't like to wear dresses or heels.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,We need a video of Greek life from  one if not all D9 fraternities and sororities and multicultural fraternities and sororities. They have customs and traditions that are amazing.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Now do sororities!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,How they going have the Try guys learn to step from the Alpha Phi Alpha but don't have any perspective from that Fraternal culture?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,In Philippines  SOME frats used their initiation rights to abuse or release their hatred through hazing thus the rise of unsolved cases of homicide and murder. It was ironic that most frat members involved in those crimes were law students.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,How does buzzfeed make a video about fraternities and leave out the D9? There are other fraternities and sororities outside of PWIs,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,What do the greek letterst stand for???,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Greek life is for people who can't make friends on their own. Who else would torture themselves just to pay for friends?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Perfect place for the down low boys,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Two theta chi members? Makes my night lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,What kind of name is DJ?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,There are also professional fraternities as well as social ones! Anyone else in Alpha Chi Sigma? :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Go SAE!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,It sounds ignorant  but I was surprised to see Andrea and Ryann in this video. I kind of assumed that fraternities/sororities did have much space for diversity (in terms of LGBT+ and POC)  but it's really interesting and kinda cool to know that specific frats exist. Still not sure if they're a good thing  but meh,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO MULTICULTURAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Infant deer smell potential compete blind crew seek until.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Fuckin geeds,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,why does every buzzfeed related video have something gay in it,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Of course the buzzfeed employees are Theta Chi alumni,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,You forgot to include anybody from NPHC (black fraternities). Do better Buzzfeed. I expect better,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,The guy in red sounds like Ray Romano,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,The lack of representation of the types of Greek Life in this video is disappointing. You left out historically Black  Asian  Latinx  and Multicultural Organizations.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,non hazing organizations.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Should have had a representative from all Greek councils. Not watching,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,What even is a fraternity??,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Commonly asked questions about sororities next please?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I wish this was more inclusive of all the different type of Greek-lettered organizations  particularly the cultural fraternities.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,No Latino or Black organizations mentioned at all.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,The way that they say the Greek letters is killing me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,What is a frat,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Ughh none of these are legit frats,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,wait how is the person with glasses and curly hair a transgender woman but also gender neutral?. im confused,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Frats are basically people trying to fit in and look cool..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I have a question too.... what are fraternities?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Anyone else think DJ sounds like drag queen Alyssa Edwards but without the Texas twang?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,Can someone explain gender neutral transgendered woman. Not making fun. Just need clarification.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Where do they get these names?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Gold convey circumstance plate major previous hello hay.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I get why things like this exist but it's still bizarre to me. It's just weird and not really good in my opinion.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Drinking alcohol should never  ever be mandatory or forced upon someone. That alone tells me "Greek life" is not a good thing.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Greek life is disgusting and toxic af I really wish it would be abolished,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I'm disappointed they didn't answer: "What the hell is the 'greek system'?" Every time I ask Americans  no one seems to know.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Wow No Divine 9 fraternity or sorority.....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,The tran talks SO SLOW,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,My friend passed pretty recently due to a hazing incident at a fraternity. I'm not discouraging anyone from joining a frat or sorority  but please be careful when and if you choose one and be safe. Frats and Sororities are great for certain people  but unfortunately sometimes bad things happen. But if anyone is looking to join a frat or sorority  please be safe. <3,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Fraternities is basically paying for friendship lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,I wonder if buzz feed can make a video without a tranny,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,GO BEARS!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

SOiJmTBzTiA,How'd they manage to get the most beta looking fraggots,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Kinda wish other countries had similar things. Would be nice to have a sort of mentor or just a place to make friends rather than just go to class and go home every day.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,Do this video again with the D9,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
SOiJmTBzTiA,No D9 tho? Boooooooo,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

i1Pi4SQZGec,This guy is awesome. One of the most inspirational stories I've heard.  Buzzfeed  I'm sorry  but your videos are *terrible*. It's so formulaic  it's disgusting. I think processes are really important  but when it's applied to EVERY. SINGLE. VIDEO. as a rule  not even a guideline  you end up with really  really  really low quality video essays. Every Ken Burns image inserted in this video was a stock image...how do I know? Description. The tipping point was this. *nameless gentleman*: "I had people praying for me at church." *buzzfeed*: insert stock clip of black people worshipping gospel style Like COME ON COULD YOU GET ANY LESS ORIGINAL.  Again  I want to reiterate...this guy has the most amazing story  so ultimately I enjoyed the video...but if you look more closely at the quality and composition of the video (because that's what I do)  it could not have been made worse. Very disappointing.  Dear Nameless Gentleman displayed in this video   Your story touched my heart. Would you please reach out to me so we can move forward with making an actual short documentary about your experience? I think it could change the lives of youth growing up in areas like Compton  Detroit  and Chicago. It's time for inner-city youth to get some attention.

i1Pi4SQZGec,This made me tear up because he reminds me so much of me and how my friends tell me i'm smart  but i tend to compare myself to others and that makes me feel like i'll never be good enough or smart enough and this was so so inspiring and i hope i get to meet him some day,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

i1Pi4SQZGec,Amazing. I am trying to do the same. I want to be a software engineer for a top company and ultimately make business of my own. I am from San Bernardino and there is nothing here. Like you said NWA put compton on the map  well San Bernardino got its notoriety by the terrorist attack that happened in 2015  but slowly it disappeared again... It is cool to live in an unrepresented city because it gives more of a chance for me to put it on the map. I hope to make this city into a booming city like Los Angeles... it will take a long time but it can be done.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

i1Pi4SQZGec,Thank you for sharing this  on multiple levels I can relate to what you're saying. I am currently going through that phase of doubt as you were. I talked myself out of it  but it comes back.

AWfBCYtJLYA,IT MUST BE HARD TO KEEP UP WITH ALL OF THE LIES......Revelation 3:9 "9 Behold  I will make them of the synagogue of Satan  which say they are Jews  and are not  but do lie; behold  I will make them to come and worship before thy feet  and to know that I have loved thee."  Revelation 1:14-15 "14 His head and his hairs were white like wool  as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;  15 And his feet like unto fine brass  as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."  The Messiah was a negro and the Most High's ONLY chosen children are NEGRO from the seed of Shem....not those who say they are Jews  but are LIARS and are ACTUALLY from the seed of JAPHETH.  YOUR PEOPLE DON'T FIT THE DESCRIPTION OF DEUTERONOMY 28....ONLY MINE DO.  Woe to all those who stole my people's nationality/true identity....and woe to those who participate in the lie/cover-up. The time of your heaven on earth is almost up.  And PS...I see why the Most High warns my people of you guys being the synagogue of Satan  it's like the MASONIC SATANIC HAND SIGNS IS A PART OF YOUR NATUAL BODY LANGUAGE.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

AWfBCYtJLYA,Jewish people that are extremists are super conservative and live away from society They hate the idea of Jesus reborn  They hate the new testament And they are cocky cuz they think they are the chosen ones of god During the time of the holocaust/WW2/even before  no one liked the Jewish community because they were so full of themselves and only married other Jews As a Christian  I don't like this at all The Jewish people in the video  however  are not like what I have listed above. They seem super nice and yea they have Jewish pride but not to the point in which they are cocky. So please don't hate on the Jewish community of the now  They are integrated with society and dropped the extremely conservative values they were supposed to follow if this were before the 1980s LOVE THIS VIDEO  And sorry I'm a history fanatic when it comes to ww2,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

d9aW3mgV4rg,Anatomicly speaking  the most painful place to get a tattoo is the palm of the hand. The pain receptors there are not only more sensitive but there are more of them since the hands are used to touch things and explore. So getting a palm tattoo is excruciatingly painful.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

I know someone who got paw prints done on the cheap  and she just had to pay a lot to cover them with roses. Also  bony areas hurt  but so do fatty ones! Do NOT get your breasts tattooed  ladies! The girls will sag  and it hurts going anywhere NEAR them! I have one that barely dips onto my sternum  and that hurt almost as bad as my wrists! For me  personally  (inner) wrists were the worst. After that  it's a tie between shoulderblade  ankle  and sternum near the breasts. The bony part wasn't bad  and neither was the collarbone  but I've heard people say that collarbone is bad and shoulderblade isn't.

BbQH0r0wPus,well. that's awfully disingenuous. Yes  it would be better to always use 100% reusables  and no  you can't stick bioplastics in your backyard compost pile. However  that's not always possible to use nothing but reusable dishware. In many parts of the country  the green bin that is collected by regional waste companies is the "compost bin" these are designed to go into. These giant compost piles get INCREDIBLY hot. 120degrees F isn't really that hot for a compost pile!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BbQH0r0wPus,Does anyone know where I can get her pink jumpsuit??????? That's a LOOK! Also it's been about 3 years since I've last used a plastic water bottle and 2 months since I've used a straw! Happy earth day everyone  let's protect our planet!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

BbQH0r0wPus,why do americans say compost/compostable like that omfg..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BbQH0r0wPus,I'm sorry but she says compost really weirdly,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

arNr4PzZ2o4,Another rich guy is a Trump supporter  news at 11.   Though I suppose if I'm being truthful here  it's another guy living off his wives millions that is a Trump supporter.

arNr4PzZ2o4,This is an attempt to discredit Kanye West and make him seem "bizarre" or "mentally ill" all because he's woke up to the fact that a select few people are manipulating the African American community.    Kanye West knows that a black artist that blows up deserves MORE than a 360 deal and a single sports car.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Po237dkzVaw,I always gets triggered whenever people say oh I hate cats because they always hurt people by scratching them and cats are aggressive all the time and every time someone says that I always tell him/her that not all cats do that plus some cats only do that because they were either raised that way or they're just scared and they don't know who to trust( mostly cats do that whenever they were Street cats),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
Po237dkzVaw,My cats love ice cream and cheese I'm calling BS on the lactose intolerant thing,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Po237dkzVaw,'If you scritch behind the kitters little whiskers'- definite cat person talk,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
Po237dkzVaw,The slow blinking thing is really useful when you want a random cat to come up to you. They almost always do it back  particularly if they're an older or shy individual. It really impresses my friends that all cats like me but it's not actually magic lol it's just that I know to slow blink at them.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

Po237dkzVaw,I had a cat that it was physically impossible for him to meow because his vocal chords were damaged as a kitten. When he would try it would just come out as a chirp or squeak.

Po237dkzVaw,Almost everyone that I've met said that they hated cats  and I was triggered every time,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
Po237dkzVaw,I found a little starving kitten in an alley who i heard meowing for 4 days! And i fed fresh homemade food that i had fed to my cat ( Who died may she rest in peace ) and he loved it! His name was sugar cause he was so sweet and kind  who left one day to start his own life and get food himself  i see a few times a week  he is all grown up and healthy!

VrxwTRjvRio,U know united is desperate cause they went to Buzzfeed,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,i would not be able to eat this much,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I can NEVER EVER eat that much.. how they do it??,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Wasabi doesn't belong in soy sauce.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I wonder if any of these restaurants are pet friendly...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I have a question to ask when you met UA did they tell you how tough are ya?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I love this  except the jokes.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Does anyone notice that the guy in pink also won? 6 1/2 and 9 both are 1 1/2 away from 7 1/2,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Imagine what they are doing while there not filming. Making fun of United?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,United absolutely sucks.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,didn't think the 6 and a half through  just wanted to sound cool,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,3:00 If you look closely you can see somebody being dragged off the plane,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I wonder how much hundreds of dollar those food costed. lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,"Neopolitan" pizza,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I feel like United is trying to erase the bad memory lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I was there at Wanderlust last June!!  I had the veggie burger.  It was DELICIOUS!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I actually like airport food,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,The pink sweater guy I want him,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,HOW CAN THEY EAT SOOOO MUCH!!!!!??????,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Boo United,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I will never forgive United for replacing moving sidewalks with overpriced nonsense. It's an airport not a destination.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I thought Buzzfeed would have better morals then to collaborate with United,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,As much as all the food they're having is looking on point  I feel kinda sorry for their stomachache  which I am pretty sure  has happened.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Lots rumors about United Airlines though,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,my wallet is crying while watching this video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Still never flying United. They make me sick,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,$ELLOUT$,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,How much did United pay them to act like self-checkouts are a new thing,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I need to go to that ramen place,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,HA!c When BuzzFeed sold their souls to United.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Southwest is a good airline.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Fly united and get your puppy murdered or if you are a doctor you get punched in the face and dragged off ...... united : The assholes of the airways",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,This is my life,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Still never flying United.  Great airport food for NY.  Not so much at LA  Dallas  Chicago  Miami  Seattle or almost any other US Airport.  United still treats you like s*&t and kills more pets than any other airline.  US airlines are moving to not allowing seat assignments without an upgraded ticket and bumping you if you don't have a seat assigned.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I have to be drinking 4 days in raw to eat like this.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,whats the blag girls name?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Now I want to go to an airport :(,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Good thing you don't have any dogs with you  United would kill them,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,So many comments are about the overbooked flight of United a while ago. While that definitely was a terrible incident  we have to realize that United is not all bad,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I realize I have been in this terminal,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Next time  try the dumpling place!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,My local airport has a burger king...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Such a lame ad...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,What a bunch of snowflakes working for a do-nothing company that just puts out idiot ridden videos. Try working for real.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Is this United attempting to improve their reputation?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,So united be beating a guy off a plane on one flight but they be bringing fresh fish back? So you telling me that they overbook on people but they never overbook fish?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Gay !!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I live in Newark and as many times as I've been in that airport I've never wanted to spend the 15 million dollars that that food cost that crap is expensive,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,So BuzzFeed (sometimes horrible) have made a Deal with United Airlines (have always been horrible)  I am only here for the food.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,0:57 Sequoia ! I thought that's what he said. But then I thought I was crazy because I drive a Sequoia and assumed I was hearing things.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,iPad at every counter woah,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,FYI Newark is in New Jersey. The video says United flies to the most destinations in NY than any other airline. That's wrong. !!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Buzzfeed agreed to work with them? Lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Such a cringey staged video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Lol.. United  u cant change ur image with this vid..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Jet blue is the best,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,new york city wall street crazy insane kk street and turns to the insane....index of economic,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I am actually very impressed with this video.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Brought to you buy American airlines,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,nahh fam,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,The worst ad I saw today.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I bet they payed more for the food than the plane tickets,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,This was uploaded on my birthday,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Me: does this Me: (an hour into the flight) *vomits it all out*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Well that was a long advert.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Never ever fly United. They killed a dog and dragged a doctor off the plane because of their own mistakes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,People think that the only mistake United Airlines has ever made was dragging a passenge.There's actually a lot more mistakes they did even after the viral video of the man getting drag off,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Track user enthusiasm prove trade affair top human shuttle spend button,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Where's the part where United kills your dog?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I swear these guys can never do anything original. Always copying someone else,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I bet they didnt even fly anywhere. Just paid to advertise for United.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I think the white woman won because I guess 8 is closer to 7.5 than 6.5 is.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Oh damn. United Airlines sponsored video. Guess they're still chasing good press,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,United airlines we dont beat our competitors we beat our customers,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Is this the airline that had a scandal that went viral a few years back?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,How are they still hungry,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Of course the person that happens to be leading this video is an Asian man...coincidence? Oh United....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Isn't this the company that had their passengers beaten up? Mate I'm from Australia and even I heard about that. Buying good publicity doesn't work once you've dragged your own name through the mud.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,this just made me wanna go to the newark airport...not fly united,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,#Jersey. And ur in my area Newark,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Think how many airport jobs are gone due to self checkout and ordering. I don't no know if that's good or bad  but they've eliminated actual people and that's the future  I imagine,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,#ad,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I can't belive you'd still partner with United after everything they've done. So low.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,I don't care that United sponsored this vid. Still never flying with them .,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
VrxwTRjvRio,Just don't get dragged in the process,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,God I wanna see someone from Europe or something walk into an American school and see 5 flags per hallway and one in each room,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,What is the woman at 1:11 saying?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,ok  i havent seen anyone that really likes iced coffee  that could just be because i live in Michigan  but in every Korean manhua  show  drama or song  they always talk about iced americanos....i mean DPR Live even has a song about it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Ac is year long thing in the south,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,NO TAX IN DELAWAREEE,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Unsubscribed,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,WTF ICED COFFEE IS LIFE LIKE WTF I DONT EVEN LIKE COFFEE THAT MUCH BUT ICED COFFE OMG ITS SO GOOD BTW IM AUSTRALIAN SO UH YA THIS VIDEO = NOT ACCURATE,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I've lived in the US for over 20 years...I was practically raised there  I still don't get most of these. But I do love iced/cold coffee when it's hot out  although that seems like a common thing in a lot of places. Also last time I checked  cigarettes are no longer sold at pharmacies  at least in California.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,As a native Floridian I can definitely say that AC is necessary all year round.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,What is wrong with flags. They show nationalism. Stop trying to pedal your globalist agenda.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I think this commercial is so weird and should be re-edit because it confuses people with the word "America" for all those who do not know America is a continent and not a country. the flag of U.S. It is not the flag of America America has 20 countries which 16 of them speak Spanish 3 English and 1 Portuguese Do not confuse people by saying that U.S. it's America AMERICA IS A CONTINENT NOT A COUNTRY  btw they call football a sport that play 98% with their hands and they call soccer a sport that plays 99% with their feet  so weird huh!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,tons of these thigns are very common in other countries as well though? cigarettes sold in pharmacies misleading to say pharmacies when pharmacies in the US are like corner stores with a bit of everything AND a pharmacy. this is the same all over mexico and south america too. in addition  korea and many parts of asian are EXTREMELY obsessed with iced coffee.... they drink it more than hot coffee in korea lol  etc etc,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I'm Australian  why am I watching this? I will never visit America anyway because I don't wanna get shoot.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Xenophobes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,They forgot the national obsession with Bill Nye the Science guy,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,The tax thing is because taxes are different depending on the state you are in.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,And the right wingers call this video anti-American  that's the one American thing I can't get over.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Tbh  it would be a lot easier if they just put tax on the tags. I'm American and I get so much anxiety from not knowing the tax bc I don't wanna go over my limit ya know?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,WHAT. I THOUGHT THESE WERE NORMAL. I NEED TO LEAVE HIS COUNTRY. NOT ONE SINGLE THING IN THIS VIDEO WAS "WEIRD" OR "STRANGE",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,As an American  none of these things make sense to me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Is it really bad to have ice coffee? I like it  also you don't wanna burn your tongue at the same time as burning your skin off :I,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,ALMOST EVERYONE BE ARGUING ABOUT COFFEE WHILE IM STANDING HERE LIKE "I DONT EVEN LIKE COFFEE",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,"AC is necessary in the summer but not all year round" it is absolutely necessary year round in Florida,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I didn't know the bathroom gap wasn't a thing in other countries???,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Ok I just wanna say that in Vienna they LOVE iced coffee. ITS NOT JUST AN AMERICAN THING DAMNIT,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Still don't understand why store clerks/cashiers or just strangers ask you "how are you?". Do I know you?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Ever wonder why the American telephone country code is the number one?      Because it's #1!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I live in Canada  and we only have flags outside of schools and important buildings. However  we have little Canadian leafs on pretty much every single logo  to show they are Canadian or smthg  even if they came from America,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Flags are popular in Sweden too,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,The gap in the toilet is so u can see if someone is using it or not,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Well the thing is that most of these things don't make sense to Americans either!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Guns,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,This video only made 65% sense.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Statement business create guidance participate since inspire pine.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Of course buzzfeed has to complain about the American flag what a bunch of unpatriotic scum bags you all are,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,So what's the big deal whit flying flags?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,If you don't like our traditions ..leave..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,The gaps are Soo big that you might as well pee with the door open,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,If you lived in Texas you'd understand the constant year round use of the A/C lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,1:25 HOW DARE YOU,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Ice coffee is delicious and other countries have their versions too. Like Thailand and Vietnam.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Ok few issues Well with the medicine ads  the reason why so much of the ad is the side effects is because they have to  and when the ad is only 30 seconds it takes up most of it  but keeps people informed. And yes while the US is one of only two countries that allow that  it actually has led Americans to being more aware about their options as well as side effects on meds than their European counterparts. Actually legally the Pharmacy does not sell the cigarettes  many pharmacies in the US are also convince stores which have a pharmacy counter for medications  in fact that counter is the only place you can pay for the prescription meds at. Cigs are sold at the convenience  store part. But technically there are different entities in the same location. When the world series was started in 1903 the only teams were in the US and Canada  over time the WBC was created for the whole world  but half of Major League Baseball is foreigners who are the best from their own countries  so it is a "world series" in way. And cold water and cola is better than warm  so why not cold? And sorry to inform you Buzzfeed but Iced Coffee is very popular in many parts of Latin America and all over the Middle East from Morocco to Israel to Dubai. It's just weird to Europeans  who are not the whole world. who gets carded when they are 50 or older? they only have to card if you look under 27  that is more Hollywood than reality Tax not included on the price tags is actually law in most places to make clothing and other items seem less expensive to stimulate more buying while with products like gasoline  or your internet bill they put the tax in the price and only if you request do they show you how much of it is taxes (about 33 cents for every dollar of gas you buy is taxes) so people dont realize how many hidden taxes there are.  But ok the gap in toilets is annoying and who knows why,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,TLDR,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Americans? I think u mean north Americans  the rest  are latinoamericans and we are completely different from them  have that in mind,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,In.my contury a commertial can take 15 minute,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Why doesn't buzzed just move their offices to the UK or something. Obviously they just like making jabs at America all the time but yet they stay here,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Why are our "weird" ways wrong but not everyone else's? I always see articles about how not to offend people in other countries but never once while during my extensive travels to Europe and Asia has anyone been able to point out the same type of article from the other perspective. I don't get the double standard...if someone comes here and does something weird/rude  etc  we are told it's just their culture/tradition but if we travel somewhere and do something deemed weird/rude we are labeled as inconsiderate Americans.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I drink black coffee hot but iced coffee exists for different reasons. If you want a sweet  creamy cold beverage with hints of coffee and the kick of caffeine then yeah! iced coffee 100%,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,The explanation for all of these is  its MURICA  WE do what WE want!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Do I hear American stereotypes?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I like bathroom gaps,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Don't disrespect my country? You can catch these American hands,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,The price tag without the final price is just idiotic. Write the damn price. It's such a cheap way to make a purchase seem cheaper than it is. The ONLY argument I've heard is "well the tax is different in each state". Oh yeah? Then change the price tag in each state. I mean come one. Some states are the size of European countries  and all those countries are perfectly capable of writing the correct  final price on each item. Again: just capitalism trying to squeeze out every last penny from people. Also the commercials for medicine. Why? They are prescription! You can't buy them yourself! So why have ads for them? The only way you can get them is by going to a doctor  getting examined and then if you have the diagnosis  the DOCTOR will prescribe you the correct medication. You have zero influence (I hope!). So why put it on commercials?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,the most shocking thing is the cashier with a chair,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Most of these things I have never understood and I am American....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Tax and Tip not included is kinda weird to me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Also: Portion Size,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,England is better,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I think the weirdest thing to the rest of the world is how Americans could vote that Orange joke into the Whitehouse. A quick Google search showed what he was about  yet somehow he got into the highest office in the country. Weird! .... I also find it weird how America goes on about how humane it is and how free  but they treat their own citizens pretty poorly; no healthcare  terribly low minimum wage  awful infrastructure and public services.... the list just goes on. Sorry Americans  America is not the greatest country on earth  far from it. It has a lot of catching up to do in every area of being a decent place for all its citizens.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,How about how your political debates are just lies  bullies  it is like watching children. And these are supposed to be your leaders?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Farmers union iced coffee. South Australian. Out sells coke,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,As an American with sensitive teeth  can we please get rid of the ice!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Residence duty largely shake decline also rice year colonial large.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Just add the damn tax to the price and round it off to the nearest convenient number(simple backward calculation).  That way you pay what u see on the tag and I dun have to search for nickels  pennies or dimes.  So freakingggggg irritating those coins.....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Because to muricans the world only consist of north america and south america  but since they hate the south so okay north america is the world,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Oh we remember what country we're from and we fly our flag proudly.  It's not so we have to remember  it's so no one else forgets how proud of America we are.  I fly the flag to show respect for all the veterans who gave or risked their lives for our freedom.  Got a problem with that?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,this video is garbage lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Believe me  many (most?) of these are weird to lots of Americans  too! (Having said that  I'd also argue that a few are mildly inaccurate. Still funny though. :-) ),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,All of the flags in the US kinda shock me  like they're everywhere! In classrooms and people's houses! In my town in the Uk we only have the flag on important places  like the castle and town hall,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I will fight whoever bashed iced coffee,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,I like how they say the ice water is weird to drink when it's cold out  but coffee ALWAYS has to be hot  even when it's warm out,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,This video was too accurate..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
udq8ggdv9PQ,Seriously tho  what's the deal with flags??,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

lns5g4THw70,Even the barista has poor latte art skills...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,0:28 i am sorry but that is the shiTTEST MILK IVE EVER SEEN,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,the milk is so rough and it's clearly burned   thats not even a nice art to begin with. is it just me or she looks extremely proud of her art?  She broke the crema and thats not a latte. Maybe she needs to spend more time learning the basic of not breaking crema instead of making "art".  Just saying.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,When they heat up the milk at the start it sounds like a chainsaw...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

lns5g4THw70,As someone who can do latte art  NOBODY REALLY CARES. you can make the most beautiful drink and people will barely glance at it and go "cool" then drink it without hesitation or look at you like an idiot.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,Does anyone have the Instagram of the two girls?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,i apologize on behalf of my fandom,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,I am a barista trainer and been in coffee for 7 years  I can tell you for latte art. It does make a difference in the taste due to the mixing of the milk  espresso and crema. A tulip will taste more seperated (top more bitter  bottom more milky) and a heart/Rosetta if done well pouring fast and having a good mix will have a more consistent taste throughout.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,i like to drink milk coffee,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,When I worked in a bakery everyone had to have coffee training and a lot of them complained but I'm like yes let me make lattes my whole shift instead of making food or having to serve.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

lns5g4THw70,its just coffee...not rocket science,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,Ugh army needs to understand just because someone did a video similar doesn't mean they copied...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

lns5g4THw70,Boring af,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,i think this is copied from BTS. ngl,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,I'm a barista at Starbucks and they don't teach you how to make latte art  so I self taught myself how to make it from YouTube. It's literally so easy to do only if you the right type of milk  aerate it properly and have good espresso shots with a nice crema on top,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
lns5g4THw70,I always try to do this when i do my moms coffee.. *ITS FRUSTRATION! !*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

lns5g4THw70,I've been doing latte art for over a year now where I work  it took me months to master not only whole milk  but soy  almond  hemp  and coconut. It's really hard to master them but it's doable. Hardest milk to work with is non fat....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

hxMbkLci7qM,Quote for a long lasting relationship : " So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday  but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you  forever  everyday. You and me... everyday. " - the notebook,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,The guys clearly at fault. Look at his demeaner,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,This is heartbreaking....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Seriously  why  WHY did you make this  Buzzfeed!?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,This totally broke my heart. She still loves him. Tears right now.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Next - video about someone taking a crap.  Media has almost covered everything in this world.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I married my high school sweetheart. He told me he "owned me" he cheated was an alcoholic and verbally abusive.   We were married 19 years it took 5 yrs to divorce him  because he was controlling.  I honestly don't miss him  not at all! I have a great husband that treats me like a Princess!  I always say " If it was like that yesterday and today  it will be like that tomorrow. " All in Love and God's Peace.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Oh boy......,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,They freacking still love each other,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Anyone crying like baby ?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Tears in her voice..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,wow that was awful.... i think i wanna go was someone running over puppies with their suv now.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,im not ok,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,One of the most underwhelming videos ever.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I'm in tears. She still loves him... You can tell,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Funny thing... I don't feel anything at all by looking at pictures with my ex husband (wedding  travelling etc.). No emotions at all! Like I see something that is indifferent to me. Total blank.  Can somebody explain this to me? I don't miss what we had. I'm actually ok with our past together   but I feel reliefed he is not in my life anymore! Sometimes (very few though) I'm just angry and disappointed with myself that I've made such a bad choice  but then again I mostly accept it as a life lesson  and something that had to exist in my life  so I am what I am today  and have that wonderful child that I raise! I'm grateful for my life  I'm positive   and I only go forward. Does anyone else feel this way?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Am I the only one that can see she still loves him,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Ay noo...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,This hurt my feelings so much,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,OMG she still loves him she needs a clean break.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,You can still see the love between them both. If they had just stuck it out during those rough times  they would probably still be together  stronger than ever.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Why people can't read others? She is NOT into him anymore. Can't you see?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I hate them for not staying together!!! <ugly crying> No joke.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,this is so sad but buzzfeed is running out of ideas,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,there's a teer in my beer,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,im not crying... im just chopping onions..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,why you do this to me ma,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

hxMbkLci7qM,This is tearing me up there's no way I'm watching exes cuddle.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,It hurts so much!!! I don't know why but I could see love for each other in their eyes. It hurts so much!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,She still loves him.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,She looks sick:(,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,His loss   sweetheart. GOD bless you may he heal your broken heart  Amen,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Most of the times its very hard to say "will you marry me" but so easy to say "It's end here" ...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,If nobody will say it then i will say it.  This guy is a spoiled idiot to not see the value in that woman.  We are room mates now is not a marrital problem worthy of divorce.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Really? You would much rather go through a divorce than nurture a relationship with your wife? Plan a date night....anything! This is why marriages are falling people think you just get married and then go with it.  It takes work   patience  understanding   ect.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Was it the booze? So sad.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,This made me so sad. You can see that she still loves him.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Sara still seems to be in love with Austin....which is sad because she accepted him when he had nothing but he decided to leave her when he wanted more.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,So super sad. People please fight for the person you love. Xxx,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Looks like she became a guy so no wonder he left,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Why???!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,They should get back together. I don't know these two but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they gave up to easily.  There still a lot of love there.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I wasn't emotionally read when I clicked this video..,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,awkward...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Everything in life is hard. People just give up to fast these days. Very sad really.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I can't tell if she's about to cry the whole time or that's just how she looks....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Being with my wife over 20 years married over 18 years and 6 kids we always get asked if all our kids are ours when out and about as it's getting rare to find families like ours  women nowadays change their partners more often than their hair styles.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Awww. She still loves him.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,She's still inlove with him...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I can feel her feelings through this video <\3,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I thought the wife was Stephanie weir,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Uugh can't even do it  hits way to close to home,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,They both look so good even now  their smiles were so genuine and happiness made them look so beautiful. But their wedding pictures were literally so gorgeous  I can't even describe. I loved her dress and her long hair and he looked so handsome. It's evident it was the happiest day of their lives and they loved each other so much.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Please. Please don't cut onions while watching this. Idiot's will think you're crying,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Not too much of this makes any sense to me......so I'm not 100% convinced this is real  BUT if it is  then yes I agree with others that they both still care very much  and it makes no sense to me why he ended it so quickly without asking her to go to therapy etc?? It's extremely odd unless there was an affair or something  and that's not the case here so my final conclusion is.............it was her HAIR!! Lol Sry  but why would any sensible woman go from that long beautiful hair to what we see today in this video?? Lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,As a person  i would never marry to any person that cos me waking up to work 4:30 in the morning. I think this woman got into this place herself.  No matter how perfect match my partner is  he/she should be financially responsible to him/herself.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Divorce has become like a normal thing now. It's so common. I fear marriage because of this.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,He was cheating and doesn't find her attractive  plain and simple,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Why on EARTH would anyone put her/himself through this?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,So emotional  when I'm feeling the strain on my relationship I look at our pics too :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,They should have gotten counseling. They still love each other,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,I can see sadness in their eyes.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,Regards,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,It's so sad.. She's still love him  I can tell.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,She looks and sounds like a cry baby . I don't know why she looks so miserable. Anyway   one thing you can tell looking at her is that she definitely is not happy.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,crying,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,And this is exactly what the system does to couples!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
hxMbkLci7qM,She needs a good long spoon.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

tMazN5uH49U,The NYC apartment was a hole in the ground.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,San Antonio you can have an apartment simular to her for way less. Then again she does live downtown. A nice 2 bed and bath near medical center here goes for about $960 to $1100. At $1500+ you might as well rent to own a home and get your money's worth.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,it's expensive because you're paying for the location. if you live in a small town just outside a big city  the cost of rent and home buying is way cheaper.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,But the noise of the freeway for the Houston apartment.....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,... I pay 700$/ month for a 4 bedroom  2 bath house in SC. That includes insurance. :o,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,I live in Houston,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Here's the problem  these buildings are totally different. The NYC one is most likely a pre-war building compared to the building in Houston where it looks new and very up to date.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Shame houston is on it's way to becoming bad like New York in the next 2 decades from people fleeing california.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,NY is the center of the Earth. dream city for me to live in.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Moved to Texas from New York.  Pay less then this for my mortgage on my home.  I'd never move back.  Only would come back to visit.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Informative,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,You can get a spacious 4 bedroom  4 bathroom  2 floor penthouse in Kuala Lumpur malaysia with a hotel type gym pool sauna etc. for that same amount. New York is just milking people,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,I keep seeing this videos  and none of them ever mention wages. NYC/NJ pays you way more money! I just cross referenced my job and I make a whopping 65% more in NJ than Houston. Extra 5k in taxes is negligible. I'll pay my high taxes till I'm 55 and rake in the cash  and then retire in one of these areas.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Tbh if you go and live right outside downtown Houston you can get a way better apt for a better price,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,1500 will get you a 3000 square foot house where I live lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Stop moving to Houston !!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,I'm in the Midwest and I spend $750 a month for a duplex with 2 bathrooms  2 living rooms (one up & one downstairs)  four bedrooms  a huge storage area in my basement with the washer and dryer and a two car garage and a huge backyard and I can have dogs and I don't have anybody living above or below me  just one person next to me. So as much as I hate living in the midwest I really love the fact that it is super flipping cheap. I've lived here for over 15 years at my landlords have never raised the rent on me. they treat me like their daughter,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,So proud of my hometown houston texas,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,No  Take this video down! we don't need yall promoting our great prices and having more people move to Houston we have enough already. Go somewhere else like San Antonio or FortWorth...smh:/,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,I feel like this video was a cheat. They showcased a $6 000/month NY apt.  not a $1 500/month one. A $1 500/month apt. in NY would be a hole in the wall with a hallway bathroom you share with everyone else living on the same floor.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

tMazN5uH49U,I live in Houston and lived in NYC most of my life. You really can't compare NYC to Houston. If I were single  I'd do my best to live in NYC. The nightlife  restaurant scene  events and museums are incomparable. What I miss most are the long walks - from Wall St to Harlem. Houston is one strip mall after another and very few places where people walk around.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,When I still lived in an apartment I only paid 300 a month in rent! And it was a 900 sq ft 2 bedroom apartment with a modern look in a decent neighborhood!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

tMazN5uH49U,Well..... in mn with $1500 rent you can get a 3-4bdrm  2bathr house on .3 acre of land.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Wait till you see what could be rented with that amount in Hong Kong........ maybe a cage,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,$1500 can get you 3 bedrooms  2 bathroom house plus a lounge  big kitchen and spacious backyard with a deck in South Africa.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,In istanbul 1500$ can get you a huge apartment with Bosphorus view of sea and mountains   close to downtown   close to sea side and surrounded-by green   5 min walk to Bosphorus,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,In London you can't get a cardboard box for 1500 a month.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,$1500 per week or per month? If per month that's pretty average compared to Sydney.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Is this why Carmelo wanted to leave New York lol.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,2000 a month would get you a livable decent apartment in Chicago  anything less is a rat hole for real.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

tMazN5uH49U,For 1500 bucks I can rent a huge  fancy house in Germany  or a playboy-esque mansion back home in Bulgaria. My 60 square meter apartment costs 500 bucks a month. Then again I don't live in a mega city. I live in a 150000 resident town. Wouldn't change it for anything.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Damn  my sister rents a 2 bedroom house for about 500 a month,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Yes  but you are stuck in Houston.  In N.Y.C. the city is a massive extension of your living.  There is always something to do.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,Notice that the woman is saying "We"  not "I". Someone's living with her so she's paying at most $750 a month  not $1500.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
tMazN5uH49U,For the money  Houston is better  but keep in mind New York City has four times the population in a geographic area half the size of Houston. For $1500 a month in my town in Alabama  I could buy a 4br/3ba house on a half acre lot. Then again  there are more people just in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens than in my entire state...it's all about demand.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

BrJxEzI9Mbg,I think this training needs to extend into giving information to children on how to spot signs in their friends and classmates and teach them to speak up about it. As someone who grew up with a shocking amount of friends who went through sexual abuse I feel that if I had just been told how to spot the signs I could have potentially prevented the abuse my friends suffered.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,"a concerned citizen" youtube content has reached a new low,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

BrJxEzI9Mbg,I'm one of those ten children... god damnit,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I was a camp counselor and we all had to take a plan to protect course. Rules such as  "you can not be left alone with any camper in an enclosed or non-visible area". When I went to school I stayed in a basement apartment of a woman's house  another renter and her two kids also shared the rooms upstairs. The little boy and girl really liked to hang out with me while I was there but I refused to let them in my apartment. Not because I was being rude  but because I wanted to be sure that when I was with the kids  I wanted to be upstairs in the shared space where the parents can see me. I thought it was best to try and train the kids subconsciously that they should only be around practical strangers close by to their parents.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Great add  thanks for the marketing campaign. Maybe you should also make a video with proper content instead of the 'before' and 'after' feeling of the people who took the training?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I think it should be made clear that adults aren't the only ones who can sexually abuse a child. Other kids can do it as well  and it can be just as harmful and traumatizing.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I went to the website of the company that gave your training. Even on the website  the information seems pretty limited. Or maybe it just seems limited to me because I am a mandatory reporter for child safety. I've had more detailed training and receive a refresher every year because I work with children (I'm a teacher and have a Working With Children check so my employer knows I've never been convicted of any child-related crimes). I know to keep my door open and/or have witnesses to protect both a child and myself if I ever need to see them one-on-one.  If you aren't sure what to do in that situation  have a look at this decision tree teachers in NSW Australia can use to know which is the appropriate path to take. https://reporter.childstory.nsw.gov.au/s/mrg,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Yay they changed the title,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,#metoo and i was like 4-5 but was happening for 2-3 years,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Just do what I would do when I was younger. Always have a knife on you,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I was molested twice by two different people before I was 7. One by a family member and the other by my friends uncle. It's definitely something that stays with you for the rest of your life. I hope you guys can shed a little more light on this topic for the sake of other children.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Sometimes there are no signs,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,This was such a good video. People really need to know about this problem. It's shocking how many people simply don't know this!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,It's crazy to be one of those 1/10.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,This is good because one of my teachers literally 2 weeks ago got put in jail for abusing one of his students,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I really don't want to be negative on a video like this but a child cannot experience anything after their 18th birthday because they're not a child anymore.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,How about the face that the vast majority of child sexual abusers are known to the child. They are often family members,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Instead of pre I thought it said pee,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,That stat is a lie,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Well you opened up the video with a horrible lie!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I got raped and assaulted  touched   used  abused  in all my schools,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,They changed the title lmao,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Okay I'm sorry  but everything that they talk about in the video isn't going to prevent a child from being sexually abused. The number of open doors and windows doesn't mean anything when the wrong people are on either side  and a child knowing what the names of their body parts are isn't going to actually prevent an adult from abusing them. And wifi usage? Are you kidding me? How is that going to prevent a child from being abused? Also  it's sad that they don't even acknowledge that children can be sexually abused by their own parents.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Wow. I actually am always popping up. And don't let my boys go anywhere not even a friends or families house w.o me or their father . Their 7 & 9 and  I always am over protective in every way. I'm so glad they have this. Everyone can learn. And I would be interested in going to that. This world is sadly dark and our children make it bright  we need to be very involved . Period. My kids have never ever been to daycare or babysat by anyone other than their uncle and gma and it's always a few adults whom watch them  if I run to the store. But literally 95% of the time they are with me or their dad. I'm lucky I've been able to have it that way.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I love that they took this class. This should be something everyone does,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Lel,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,How about give ppl the tools instead of having people talk about the tools they were given,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,474th,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I have a question i would like to ask.  We as adults are trying to reduce and prevent child abuse but (and i am not trying to  be mean)  The trans and LBQT community are trying to do the opposite with putting adult men in bathroom with little girls and there are people out here that are truly trying to get child sexual abuse legal.  NAMBLA they are all connected.  I am not trying to say all gay and trans people are into it but there are those that are.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,0:14 the word you're looking for is "its" @Buzzfeed not "it's",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Whahahhaha omfg this is just to funny,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Le croix,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Never be to bashful to use CORRECT medical terms. Knowing victims of child sexual abuse makes you more aware of kids in your life. It makes you take note of things you normally don't. For example around the age of 13 we had a new neghboir move in. By 14 I felt that the father next door was a little TOO touchy feely and aggressive towards his kids. I said something to my mom on a particularly awkward day because The man and his kids were infront of their house one day and as the son started heading towards the play ground the girl looked uncomfortable. You could tell she wanted to join in but he had her sitting in his lap. When she finnally got up he put his hand under her skirt as if fixing her underwear and she took off quickly to go play. I told my mom because I though it was odd and she told me to stay away from him  Then she talked to the mother about the sittuation. For a a little while I stopped seeing the dad or daughter come outside when the son woujld be at the playground. And he would come to the screen door and hawk eye his son. A few months later we heard a bunch of screaming and arguing and him rushing out the house. A little while later cops were outside which wasn't something unusual for them  so we just assumed he hit her again and left. We found out later from the neighborhood gossip that he was indeed touching his own daughter. The part that disgusts me now is even knowing it happend even after they moved out went grocery shopping with my dad and spotted them months later all togeather. If you know someone in your childs life is a danger to thier well being DON'T claim to be a good parant when you continue to put them in a stressful environment.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Egg,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Why does the instructor look like Hela from Thor Ragnarok,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I learned nothing and gained very little. A redundant statement  I know. But I reeeeeaaally thought that this video was a waste of internet space. This subject is so huge and broad that so much could have been said about it. Yet we got a sort of advertised lesson on why you should take the training. Bazaar.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Finally  a video with substance and purpose. Good job buzzfeed,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,My bad  i thought this was gonna teach me what to do if a child sexually abuses me...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I am 6foot6 and 15 not 4 me bitches,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Want to reduce it? Start killing the fuckers that hurt children. If someone is convicted of it.. do the world a favor and put a bullet in their heads. Maybe then it would show possible perverts that the rest of us aren't going to just essentially slap them on the wrist for harming our kids.  Anyway.... I have 3 young kids and this makes me sick to my stomach to think that this could happen to them. It happened to me when I was a child  it happened to my husband too. We live in a very fucked up world with very fucked up people that don't need to be in it anymore IMO.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,They should add the word prevention in the title  it sounds weird otherwise,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I work at a primary school and we teach the kids that their body is theirs and nobody else is allowed to touch them inappropriately or touch them at all if they don't want it. And that they always should tell an adult that they can trust even if the person tells them they aren't allowed to tell and we have posters with their rights all over the school (illustrated and formulated in a way that the kids can understand it). I think every school should do that!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Thought this would be more informative than it actually is...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Good and now how about training against emotional abuse?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,You can prevent sexual abuse  you could avoid it  you could try your best to stop  but it will never ever end  because there are still going to be messed-up people everywhere.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Abusers have to learn. Not the victims. It's so sad. You gotta be SICK to abuse a child (or just an alive soul) like this makes it look normal everywhere and it shouldn't,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,who would dislike this kind of video?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I have been abused,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,If you're interested in this and you're in Australia  we have "protective behaviours: A Personal Safety Program". There are resources online  in addition to training workshops for both children and adults. There are psychologists trained in this also  and many Australian schools incorporate this into their health classes.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I've always wanted to know how to sexual abuse children and now they have training classes?!? Hell yeah    (Don't get butt fucked it's a joke),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,it's employees ...............................................?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,This video is brought to you by La Croix.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I hope Buzzfeed took this seriously and did so in order to help abused children  and not just to have content for a video.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Highly highly doubt that 10% of kids get molested,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,why the hell would 150 person dislike that vodio  can someone tell me?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,This issue isn't only adults preying on kids it is also kids preying on other kids  older kids to younger kids  kids in the same age range  or children who have been victimized and don't know how to cope so they repeat what's been done to them to other children.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I will be like im gonna break your neck if do anything to me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,What if a child does it to another child? Why is this also only about little children.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

BrJxEzI9Mbg,Liberals are the ones abusing children sexually. And Hollywood is the mecca of liberals,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Important not to make kids scared of the world too. Reasonable suspicion perhaps but telling kids that all adults are potential serial rapists is just going to make them cowards,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I felt SO emotional watching this. I've been sexual  physically  and emotionally abused all my life. The signs were all there  and it took ME to beg my mom to take me to therapy. I've had horrible therapists too. I'm only 17 and i've finally gotten a good one  and it just makes me feel so? Jealous? That these people are so caring. I just wish someone cared for my safety like that.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,In US I guess every child is sexually abused  this country is obsessed with pedophilia,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Dissapointed with the real video  was expecting the title :(,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,Instead of making a video about people taking this class you should post one about those five steps.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
BrJxEzI9Mbg,I'm not surprised at all by the prevalence.  The more I talk about my experience the more I realize how often it happens to other people.  I just wish my parents were more involved in my life for me to have trusted them.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

wFkOG2_D6wk,I love her and all of her outfits! Amazing style! She should hang out with chantelle.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
wFkOG2_D6wk,She's so awesome I love her she should be in more videos,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
wFkOG2_D6wk,I have never related to someone so hard in my life. This is just like when I was trying to make friends when I was in highschool and I didn't know anybody. Except Emily handled it better than I did!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

wFkOG2_D6wk,SHE'S SO CUTE,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
wFkOG2_D6wk,I've done this a few times in the past and felt a lot of these feelings. I'm so glad people are more able to talk about being anxious in certain situations with the people in those situations with them these days. It makes me feel a lot more like I can get through stuff and there's gonna be a team of people who are just happy I want to interact with them anyway. (I mean  hopefully. I don't really have enough opportunities to make friends these days but this makes me feel more able to do so!),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
wFkOG2_D6wk,I just started a new job and I was thinking about doing something similar (having lunch with my coworkers) but I feel like I would be too awkward and I believe it went really well for her because she had the best excuse that everyone at buzzfeed uses to get people to interact with them which is "this is for a video". Also  I feel like I would be super awkward because if I get nervous then I just forget to think and can't carry a conversation >_< That was my ramble... have a goodnight lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
wFkOG2_D6wk,She's so cute,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

OlHyWSAZAFg,and BY THE WAY  pineapple on pizza makes it a little better and healthier.

OlHyWSAZAFg,OUIJA/SPIRIT BOARDS ARE NO JOKE! IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY BRAIN CELLS TO DISMISS IT AS NONSENSE  ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SCARED  WHEN YOU COULD JUST USE YOUR HEART AND BRAIN AND STAY AWAY FROM MESSING WITH WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND and also learn! It's opening a doorway to an inbetween and anything could come through  no matter how good or how bad! And you don't know how to close it or cleanse and purify the space after!

OlHyWSAZAFg,As a horror movie fanatic the movie was okay  but far from terrifying. Maybe I just don't scare easily  but there are several other horror films on Netflix that I believe are scarier.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
OlHyWSAZAFg,Winner past base discrimination giant terror accommodate freeze,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
OlHyWSAZAFg,If anyone considers this a good horror movie I'd be shocked. The only thing scary is the jump cuts. In my opinion.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
OlHyWSAZAFg,It was a good movie  but not scary at all. It would be a good starter movie,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
OlHyWSAZAFg,It was a good movie but it wasnt as scary,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,That's why you don't measure in cups America...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Salt is generally not healthy in the quantities we use it though  and cutting down on salt will actually enable you to taste more delicate flavors.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,"Cooking can be difficult" Yeah if you're an absolute idiot.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,0:19  so of your steak for example tastes bad. So you pour handfuls of salt onto it and expect it to taste better  like no,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,But I always stir my rice and it never comes out soft or mushy. Maybe because I only do it a few times? I also cook it a little so it has that nice golden look before boiling it. It tastes great :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,Omg Lilo and Stitch I love that show it practically raised me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Who loves buzzfeed !? Its entertaining !!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Mesure cups are in the past get a damn kitchen scale !,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,These are valid points  but having different pans is nice  but not required   and preheating cast iron is wasting electricity. I am in an apartment and I am a college student I don't have the space or budget for extra oils  pans  and fancy things. I am a great cook and baker without most of these things   plus measuring dry in wet and wet in dry isn't the end of the world  it gets you close enough and I have never had an issue.   Also cuts of meat  I have to disagree about getting that exact cut  because just based on thickness and fat content is enough  I don't do fancy cuts of meat and will go for the cheaper cuts because it's going to be tossed in the slow cooker or seasoned so it all tastes the same,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Do tours of your childhood bedrooms,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,Add more salt  they say. Thanks  I'd rather eat less salt and live longer.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Another reason why the metric system is way superior  we use deciliter  mililiter or liter for both dry and wet ingredients  as well as weighing by grams/kilos for everything as well. No confusing cups  ounces  etc.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,i definately learned to cook from cooking shows as a child  i only do about 3 of these mistakes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Lesson 1:  "You don't add enough salt."   6 seconds later: "Add salt.... but don't add too much."  Well.  That clears *that* up.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,I was fairly sure we covered this whole moving article bs video format in 2015. Please no.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,my apartments got an old oven and it kept burning everything.  i got an oven thermometer and realized it was baking at 50 degrees higher than the dial said it was  so if i set it for 350 it was actually cooking at 400.  big difference now,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,you know you watch too much buzzfeed when you recognize the bread zach baked at 2:29,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,I think this video is hard to read as the subtitles spread out from one side to another. For me   it's too wide.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,#16: rushing things in general. Some recipes take time  deal with it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,i got no time for cooking  i work too much just to make ends meet. 30 mins to warm up a pan wastes soooooo much money,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Uses a rice cooker. Cannot relate to rice cooking problems. Lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Ok so I have been doing everything right,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Did anyone else notice Zach's (sorry if it's spelled wrong) bread in the background.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

-eWZbzKswhQ,Can u post enemy's try hand casting,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,Dont use canola oil ffs its so bad for the habitat just use olive oil its fine,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
-eWZbzKswhQ,As soon as video advised use of canola  I knew all its advice is suspect and I'll be unsubbing. Canola _ Canada Oil = Rapeseed Oil / Linseed Oil (paint thinner) is GMO and I refuse to eat anything using it -- read the ingredients! Instead I use butter or maybe olive oil. My worst kitchen habit  though  is leaving dishes to "soak" and not washing them right away  before food can stick. I'm improving on doing that though.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

jOIy6UHZikk,Until you're past college age  hooking up can mean anything. It could be kissing  penetration  a handshake  a trip taco bell lol It's a blur. But once you're like 25 and up  a "hookup" entails that clothes were off  things were done  and they may or may not happen again lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up is definitely anything past making out.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Ronnie Fieg is the interviewer,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Anything involving exposed genitalia however all parties must receive some action and enjoy it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Were I am from we call it "Tapping off".,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,while me thinking hooking up is same as one night stand ... hmm,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,yeah i definitely think a hook up is anything past making out. that's how i've described my past encounters. i've heard many hook up stories as well and none of them were just about kissing. and now that i think about it  i didn't really know what hooking up was until high school because that's when a lot of folks starting doing a lot more than just smooching!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Cont me in for another one of the "Least Voted". Boy am I naive. :\,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,hookup def means sex,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hernados is so hot! Is he gay??,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,It's when you make eye contact,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Loved the animations tho!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,a hookup is like probably a handjob/oral,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up is the most vague statement ever!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I define a hookup as a one night stand,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,P to V  V to V and P to A not P to P,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Growing up i always assumed it was making out (I grew up in australia and nz) while from the majority of a US perspective it means sex so now idk haha,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,A blow/handjob isn't in the hookup rulebook for me because it seems more like a favor than a mutual thing,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I've had this discussion with my friends so often. What I noticed was that my british friends call making out hooking up and my american and aussie friends call sex hooking up,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,it bothers me because if someone says they hooked up I have no idea what they mean lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Other range great legislation boss blend elementary basic estimated scared typical.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Depends on the person lol..  If it's someone famous  hell yea I'll say hookup even if it's just a kiss LOL If it's someone I regret  like a coworker then yeaa it was just "making out",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,LMAO can't say this isn't accurate,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,naked competitive cool universe out hospital company considerable wish.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Please dont put the word(hookup) in the thumbnail,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Still wondering how you P to P. Like sword fighting?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up means having sex  everything else would be fooling around!!! Obvi.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,i thought hookin' up meant meeting someone somewhere to have fun  like  at the bar. Friends can hook up. workmates can hook up and married couples can hook up......ya know?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,so this is where the antifa foulmouthed humanities children  hang out !,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I never use this word cause no one can agree. If someone says hook up I ask them what they mean.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I think the best way to describe it is if someone tells you they hooked up  you believe they meant regular sex. You then dont ask the person for clarification  really.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I am also with the mindset of hooking up equating to making out. At least. I don't really like imagining people in sexual situations. I get that it's a part of life. I just don't need your information to be a part of MY life  ya feel me?   We're friends  but we're not THAT good of friends. I don't need to think about your dingy.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,LOL the 'shook' over his eyes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Who dat? She's really cute @2:11,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I think if you're highschool age  "hookups" are when you're making out with someone in a sexual way  but as an adult  a hookup is when you meet with someone you're not dating for the purpose of an orgasm. You don't hook up with your boyfriend or girlfriend.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Oh please   BuzzFeed don't get new ideas so now they ask people what's a hookup. Clearly hooking up is having sex that's it. The dictionary exists,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I think a HOOKUP  is an umbrella term that can be used so you don't have to go into details about what exactly you did with someone. Because you could say: "oh yeah we hookedup at a bar"  which could go from the simplest "yeah we made out or we fucked in the bathroom stall.",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Its having sex  duh!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up is anything pass making out  that encludes hand jobs  fingering  touching eachptgrr and any type of sex,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,how would p to p work,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,1:12   ...shook,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,The only hookup I get is when my friend who works at Starbucks gives me a free Frappuccino.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I have the hugest crush on Fernando <3 would definitely hookup with him ;),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Idk but I wanna hook up with Fernando. And that means oral givin to him or him fuckin me. Or both. More like both. Ty.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,https://youtu.be/BH63SuKCrnE,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Where did he got hlthe Greenpeace Windbreaker ?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I feel like the term is vague on purpose. That way you can say you can say with confidence that you have had some kind of sexual contact  but you dont have to say how much.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Even masturbating   them on  your mind    is a hookup  )),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,P 2 anything.............,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,A F*CK!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up means f*cking and that's it hopefully you dont see them later,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Hooking up: Something you dont want to see your parents do,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,P to P -> made me think of a gay couple dueling their penises like light sabers. Kinda makes me want to hook up with a guy just to try that out.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,You and your friends will agree and will not agree with something  but that does not mean you have to make a big deal like this. This is just BuzzFeed trying to get views.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I agree with the comments about sex and oral sex being sex. I think insertion equals sex which is why I can't get on board with a handjob being a hook up. But fingering is definitely some form of sex.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,The reason it it so loose on definitions is because to one person who doesn't usually perform sexually  at all  making out is a huge thing but for someone who regularly has sex  then thats hooking up. It's different for everyone,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,im in high school right now (I live in NY if maybe other people from NY agree) and to us hooking up means making out or anything beyond that  but not usually sex. like if you made out with someone over the weekend and maybe went a bit further  you'd say "oh yea I hooked up with blank "" but you'd also specify "and gave him a hand job." hooking up also is for a make out sesh lasting AT LEAST two minutes. that's just our school though :),BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,So hooking up is just making out...  with your clothes off... With touching involved...  and orgasms.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Omg so many p*rn stars in the replies of comments XD,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,Also  this guy has said handjob so many times this video,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,He's so cute,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,IMO hooking up is anything involving genitals,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,P to P?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,A waste of time and love ....,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,I have been waiting for this damn video my whole life lmao still confused but mildy at peace,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

jOIy6UHZikk,Hey buzzfeed world! I am Erik With a K! Im a small creator  I post every night at 8pm  and recently just posted a video about what it is really like making videos as a small creator! If this interests you then go check it out!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
jOIy6UHZikk,i didn't know this was such a universal problem...i'm a non-native speaker  and i personally always thought it meant sex  until i watched the norwegian teen drama skam and got really confused. in the show  they repeatedly refer to making out with random people at parties as 'hooking up'  and i kind of just assumed that i was wrong about the meaning. but turns out there's a discourse? damn.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

TynuSP1bDtg,Once my dad took ages to order and I leaned towards the waitress and asked "Are we annoying?" Then after a puase she shrugged and said  "Kinda.",BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I disagree half of the content  servers that thinks like that is a selfish server that only care about making money with tips.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,yeah no. there's no way im tipping on take out.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,tip on a to go order?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,If you get paid so little that you need tips to survive just get a job with higher salary.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I am not tipping for a to go order..thats like having to tip someone on a drive=thru,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I got a bartender responsibility ad before this O-O,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,In the UK  tipping really isn't a thing.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I was a server throughout high school and i disagree with like half the things on this list. Just paints servers to be like sensitive and easily annoyed...,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,So true. Everyone should have to work in the food industry one day so they know what it's like,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I don't get why bartenders would complain if you hang out with your friends after you finish the meal and the place isn't packed. It's not like you're bothering anybody.  This tipping for a to-go order seems like another american thing. Those "servers" are basically cashiers. I don't tip at the supermarket  why do I have to tip there?  Also  there should be a sign saying that I have to wait to be seated somewhere. How am I gonna know that's the policy when a lot of other restaurants just allow you to sit anywhere where there isn't a little "reserved" plaque on the table?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Tipping is for chumps,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Restaurant owners should pay their servers more so tips won't be required. Some may be faced with costumers who are very demanding. But then tipping should also be a choice. We surely do not tip the janitors at the malls or at school and their job is considered as a low paying job as well. But the difference is the servers are handling our food so we better watch out or else... LOL,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,i tip no worries...but u shouldn't have to tip..thats the american way of thinking..not a fan,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Never tipped a to-go order and probably won't ever. Although everytime when I hand back the signed receipt  they always expect a tip cuz they're furiously focusing on that tip line.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,do servers tip at fast food joints?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I thought this said things to do to annoy not things you do,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I never annoy people in my Christian minecraft server,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Some of these reasons are making servers look like cry babies,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I hate it when you fuckers have 50 open tables and you cram everyone together!   I want space from others.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I am actually a good tipper...tip 30-40 dollars no matter how bad the service is,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,This is so accurate,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I dont even know wher to start with this  you get payd to do the job and i payd to stay in that place  a person can stay in the restorant as long as they want  why didnt the people outside call in and make a reservation + its not the only food place in the streat  then "complaining" about something when we ate it after you asking  "Was everything ok" is normal. I think a person whos complaining about this even tho in the USA you have to get tips  doesnt know how lucky they are  and souldnt do that job.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Why are so many servers so arrogant and entitled? You don't your wages? Don't work there! You don't need to be handed money for putting some food in a paper bag and handing it to someone. I work fast food and do it all day. Ain't that difficult .,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I don't snap at my dogs  I (sometimes) snap at people. Buuuuut not strangers  particularly not people who serve me! :D,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Just pay them the minimum wage like any other job. Whats the big deal?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,in nz we don't do tips.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I will never tip for to go orders.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I want you assholes in your job to tell a customer who asks for water and lemon to tell them "WELL THEN JUST GET LEMONADE". See how well that flies  and how well your shiftiness is received. Decency is a two way street  and getting pissy at customers who do things that can't even be classified as annoying and are asking for basic service is part of the reason why the customer/server relationship is so toxic.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Snapping is the worst. I will actually leave that table till last if I'm snapped at,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Say people as'hole and still want the full tip? Who's the ahole actually?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,most of this is pretty foreign to me :p strange how just going to get some food can be such a different experience from one country to the next lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Getting water  lemon  and sugar packets to make lemonade is something a lot of diabetics do. This way they can control the amount of sugar in the lemonade. If you order it  there's no way of telling.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,To all those from other countries I know in Europe that you don't tip or if you do it's for special occasions but I'm from Arizona in the US and we get 7.50 an hour as a server because we are in tips now the minimum wage for non tip earning employees is 10.50 an hour if a server doesn't earn at least $3  an hour  2 equal  10:50  the owner  of the restaurant  the supposed to match  $3 on a paycheck to equal to 10.50 owner of the restaurant  match whatever we don't make during that week . because of this restaurants are now up to 10 cents per credit card tip that server has to pay because the credit card company changes the restaurant is charged that the restaurant gets charged for the customer useing a credit card. I agree our country should get it together and pay their people better. The US is different each state can decide on what their minimum wages is.  some states do good where a server can make a living off of no tips most don't . so please if you're from another country and coming to ours understand there is not a federal law to say what your server get paid it a state by state bases .  Don't get me wrong I love my country but we are very large country in the middle to figure things out. our differences between state and federal is difficult to understand it's one thing that makes my country great but also compose a lot of contention and problems before I start rambling a little tip pun intended if you have a good server that is giving you good service and you're in the US give them a couple bucks really they eran it. General amount in most places is 10 to 15% of the total bill it's really not that much but it goes a long way. And trust me it's just as hard for Americans will go to other countries and leave money on the table and get weird looks because we did,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

TynuSP1bDtg,Cookie nine Catholic committee way just strike succeed neither north.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,the people that come to dine at a restaurant 10 minutes before close are literal assholes,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Wait what's the "I hated it" joke they're talking about?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Both my mom and dad are servers  they make the "I hated it" joke all the time!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,9. Asking for lemons and sugar packets.  While I NEVER personally have done this  I don't see ********ANYTHING******** WRONG with it.  There's MORE MONEY TO TIP YOU WITH IF THE PERSON DOESN'T SPEND $2.50 or more for each lemonade.  This one just sounds LAZY!  What is the difference in getting condiments or bread or chips n' salsa(the restaurants that give that for free)?  Also  DRINK FREE REFILLS  WHAT IS THE DAMN DIFFERENCE IN THAT? It's work you won't see on the check.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,11. Tipping on to-go orders.  Taking the order  pack it  making sure it's right  well MCDONALD'S DOES IT FOR NO TIP AT ALL  SO WHY IS THAT **********FAIR OR MORALLY RIGHT TO TIP ONE EMPLOYEE FOR DOING THE **********SAME AMOUNT OF WORK**********  BUT NOT THE OTHER? NO  NO TIP! IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THE MCDONALD'S CASHIER THAT MADE MY SHAKE OR FRAPPE' DOESN'T GET A TIP  BUT YOU DO!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,5. If your food is wrong  it's most of the time YOUR SERVER'S FAULT:  1. They can put in the order wrong. 2. They can bring it out obviously totally wrong. 3. They can bring out something on the food obviously wrong(such as you said sauce on the side  it's on the food). 4. They can forget to bring you an item(a side of ranch or side dish or whatever).  So yeah  we have EVERY FREAKIN RIGHT to lower the tip when these things happen. It's only ***FAIR***!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I really don't understand this whole tipping thing in America... tipping the waiter doesn't make much sense to me because that's his job  to serve us. At least though that I can understand it to some extent. Tipping on to-go orders though??? Because "someone still has to take the order"??? That's literally ALL they're getting paid for... what kind of logic is that?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Hands up to any one to get there. Puck tooken away at the brew house lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,There has to be a pretty compelling reason to tip on to-go. Tips are usually reserved for servers  bussers  and bartenders. None of those people touch my to-go. I'll tip for customer service at a place that isn't a sitdown place (I always tip for coffee  ice cream  smoothies  etc.)  but at a normal restaurant  it takes a lot to earn a tip on takeout. Delivery  on the other hand  is something meant for tipping. A good driver always gets an additional tip. But if the restaurant has a delivery fee  I take that out of the tip. I'll keep cash on hand if the driver deserves a bigger tip.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I like tipping! But every now and then  I'm like..."the food was great but the server was a jerk". So I just tip the cook. As a server  I tip my cooks  bartenders and dishwashers.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Servers mustn't expect a tip. It is merely a way to appreciate their assistance.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,lol You have a job  why should we feel obligated to give big tips or tips at all. If you wanted free money  start a go fund me page. Everything else is super annoying though.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Thoughts on how much a tip should be? For example if my meal costed me $40 how much is a reasonable tip? Again "reasonable" not everyone can afford to tip and for some people they have to save up just to go to a descent restaurant and have a nice meal.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Anyone else go to a restaurant and they just add the tip to your bill? Do you agree with it? Thoughts?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Why cant anyone be allowed to go out to eat unless they always tip atleast 20%? I guess it must be nice when your restaurant starts cutting people and youre one of them because of slow business. I dont tip just because I got some food in my system  I tip based on service.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Everything on here  100%!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,0:40 WHO CAN HATE ON BREAD. TELL ME.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,if i want to sit at the table and theres not a line outside the restaurant  why cant i? thats not right.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I hate it too when people stay LONG after their meal. I mean  when I'm with my friends and my family we tend to do it too  but even I get annoyed at them. Unless there isn't a huge line  then I'm like whatever about it.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Lol is anyone else out there that's like if a place has a delivery charge they dont tip?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Makes video including why America is weird to the rest of the world  Also makes video including two things about tipping,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,If you tip in the place where I live  they will look at you weird.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Waiter takes your order : must tip. Waiter brings you food : must tip. Waiter pick your dirty plates : must tip. Waiter serves you : must tip. So what actually are your salaries for? Doing nothing?  I'm sorry   I respect you and your job  but your system sucks  don't blame it on the customers.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,Okay  thank god I actually do none of these things,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,The  "I hated it" joke is a Dad Joke. You can't get rid of those.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

TynuSP1bDtg,anyone else hate it when u have to read it lol,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,when is tipping such a mandatory thing in the US  when I had some good service yes by all means I would pay extra to give positive reinforcement. But sometimes the service and food are both bad and I still gotta tip? It feels being robbed.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
TynuSP1bDtg,I tip. BUT  I think it's time we force these large corporations to PAY A LIVING WAGE!!!,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

LmrZnTuL0oU,Historian here.  There were black people in the west in the 1870s (what I estimate for the setting in the themepark  though it's also kind of an arbitrary cocktail of vaguely mid-late 19th century).  It's historically accurate in the sense that  you know  there were black people.  They existed (can't believe I have to say this).,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
LmrZnTuL0oU,Westworld is the western version of the tv show Lost.  Very confusing.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

And hey  for all those being condescending towards this generation  being Gen Z has its positives too. While there's obviously nuance  and every generation has their negatives  research find this generation to be more socially responsible  practical  and even entrepreneurial compared to the previous generations.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

mHVDxSZeDEo,No excuse for nit getting LEGAL...........DACA was simply a way to keep cheap labor in the country anf give amnesty without causing a civil war,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Illegal alien taking an acting job from an American. Deport. Deport. Deport. We only want European immigrants. No more minorities.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Finally a president doing the right thing. Gotta love America.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Anyone who wants to cancel DACA is ignorant,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Americans are dreamers too.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Buzz Feed  so full of lies  and executed expertly. The video makes the viewer feel empathy  this is called effective propaganda The truth: Most of the population doesn't support DACA. Large liberal cities on the coasts have monopolies on the media  whereas middle America has little media representation  project the opinion that "most" Americans support DACA. But the truth is America's majority is under White European Americans  the de facto founding stock of the nation  and we do not support DACA. And it's not about racism  but it is about race to some degree. Any idiot knows that flooding a nation with foreigners when there is job growth won't benefit any of the nation's people except the richest  because they can higher the foreigners at the lowest wages and salaries - the business owners. It makes it impossible for the European stock  we the people  which created the whole government and economic system  to compete with the foreigners. Therefore the rich profit  the new immigrants replace native social standings  and a new class of poor people are continually created through immigration. And competition is fine  but standing no chance is no competition. And a Salvadoran who just entered the country  for example  can/will gain a nursing degree/trainimg paid for through government grants i.e.  American's tax dollars  will be given a job before the European American whose family had paid federal and state tax for hundreds of years. Immigration destroys the potential prosperity of the population. Immigration makes the history of a people futile and the concept of representative democracy futile as well.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

mHVDxSZeDEo,The govt. is in the business of hurting feelings  the business of america is business is an obselescence.  The govt. must constantly experiment with hurting people who are cornered so it can fullfill it's primary mission  surviving the act of war perpetrated on Sept 11. There may be people in the state dept. who can assist people in citizenizing themselves in other countries  perhaps places they have family.

mHVDxSZeDEo,To all DACA recipients and all undocumented youth who unfortunately don't qualify or didn't apply  stay strong. Tough times are coming  but this is a moment where we must stand up for what is right.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,I am sorry but I an not for DACA...it is a band aid on a more serious issue...Immigration Reform! DACA only applies to a certain age range excluding older immigrants that were brought here as children. We need to push for Immigration reform to be fair to all.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

mHVDxSZeDEo,I'm a Trump supporter and I'm also a legal immigrant so I understand what you're going through. So I support DACA. It was unfair for the children to be forced to come here illegally with their parents.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,If your undocumented  you should be deported.  You should not get a free pass to citizen ship.  If you were brought into the country by your parents when you were a baby/child.  They caused your problem  be mad at them  no one else.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

mHVDxSZeDEo,The only blame you can place this on is your parents they didn't go through the process of gaining citizenship  my parents were refugees of the Salvadorian civil war went through the process took   7 years but they became a citizens legally when someone says they have done everything possible than your missing something cause my parents did it while still having cousins living in the us for 20+ years don't even speaking english,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

mHVDxSZeDEo,Daca should have never been created. Come here legally,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,WOW There is some inaccurate statements here. Trump is not moving Daca out of his own. The thing Obama signed is temporary and the state is suing the white house for that. Trump already propose to give people under Daca citizenship if the democrats makes a deal with him to build a wall. Democrats refuse. I'm happy for the guy living his dream. However  false reporting gets to me.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Thank you for this.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,Sometimes the only solutions is a revolution,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,How many of Congress and the Representatives ancestors came here through Ellis Island and the other immigration centers? They'd count as DACA then if the rule was in force. People refuse to remember that most of them came from immigrants.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
mHVDxSZeDEo,When I finally obtain my Green Card (paying for it  merited of course)  I wish America cancels DACA and has fewer ILLEGAL immigrants  so it becomes a normal country like others  not overly-altruistic and UNFAIR,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

8bQf9URnIAY,Don't worry  Intelligent people always cheat because they know deep down School is useless.

8bQf9URnIAY,You know  professors are generally pretty nice from my experience. You just talk to them and tell them you're stressed and you can usually get an extension if you need it. Maybe this is a little different for me because the majority of what I do is written work  like essays and creative writing  but just asking is usually the best bet.  I guess this girl's story just teaches you that cheating is way more work than actually doing what you're supposed to.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

8bQf9URnIAY,And turns out  He was a- Me: A MURDERER ON THE RUN? Professor at my new school.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,5:21 it is if you wouldve gotten an a otherwise,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,4:44 me,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,It's not cheating at all. What matters if that you know the stuff eventually. Like what does it matter if you know the information 2 days later? Don't know why the professor just didn't think: eh  whatever  let her make the test 2 days later. Who cares?,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,*I think she's cringey*,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,Sounds like a fake story.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

8bQf9URnIAY,Final test and the prof left her all alone? Oh come on......idk what kind of university you going to but if i wrote this to my prof(any of them) or that i am sick etc they would be like ok you can do it next year/semester....its university nobody care if your flight got cancelled,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,savage,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,I could that XD lol nahhhhh way to risky for meee,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

8bQf9URnIAY,I am so into this,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
8bQf9URnIAY,So my school would check our pockets before we went to the toilet if we had to during an exam. But thing is... If we wore our PE pants under  they wouldn't know and hence wouldn't check. That means that theoretically if I have a question on sketching graphs that I do not know how to do... I could use my phone to check.  I never tried this though,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo

aYIE_cq_Qr0,Ok...  has no one told these people what happened to the original actor for the tin man in the wizard of oz? Aluminum powder is INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS. Do some freaking research before you do something which makes fine metal particulates. Anyone sanding this thing needs to go get a chest x Ray- especially if they developed a cough after being around all that dust (without even a freaking mask). Anyone who handles metal would be able to tell you you can get a better effect with just a chasing hammer.,BuzzFeedVideo,BuzzFeedVideo
