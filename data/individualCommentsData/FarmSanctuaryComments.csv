kxh7nMZfy9w,Beautiful video. Vegan forever x,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,If it wasn't for meat  Frank would have never been born... Sad freaking truth. Once we learn how to produce tasty meat in the lab  all those farm animals will become obsolete.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Everyone subscribe,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Poor Frank must have been terrified he couldn't get into that trailer fast enough such a beautiful soul Thankyou so much for saving him you are all so kind bless you.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,It was a Halal slaughterhouse he fled.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,i am eating tri-tip while watching this  i would have slapped a slice of cheese on frank's ass if i could have gotten to him first,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,These Slaughter houses need     Sanctuary Phone number to call   when these  animals break free  and the police need   sanctuary  phone numbers.... instead of back to the  slaughter house,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Cows/pigs/chickens are friends not food.   Cows are the most sensitive  intelligent  sweet animals  there are so many fantastic reasons to be vegan and one to eat meat.    The new US and Canadian food guides now recommend plant based diets too.   It is criminal to eat meat  and to put animals through hell at slaughterhouses.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,great,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

Really  happy for  Frank ! pity  about all the  others . A Huge Thank you for the people  that saved his life . You are one in a million .,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,What about the owner who was cheated out of his livestock monetary value?  the meat from that cow could have got a pretty penny!  at least some NY steak and nice Rib-eyes! shame on the rooters for turning their backs on the farmers who work hard all day to feed the livestock and fatten them up so they are nice and plump with a good percentage of fat!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

kxh7nMZfy9w,I cried more the last 2 minutes and 59 seconds than I think I did watching any of the other animal rights documentaries. This is so beautiful. THE most important reason I am so happy to be loving to California in less than a month is that I will be surrounded with so many more like minded individuals that do awesome shit like this. You guys are absolutely amazing people. Thank you so much on my behalf for all you do.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Hes so cute! Je wanted to live and im so glad he got his wish!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Goosebumps......,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,Halal is such a cruel method of killing animals.  They cut the animal's throat and let it choke on its own blood until it falls to the floor and bleeds out.  It is truly sickening that humans can do this and stand there and watch the animal die.  It is evil.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kxh7nMZfy9w,GREAT VICTORY.. THIS LITTLE GUY REALLY SAVED HIMSELF IN THE FIRST PLACE.. HE WANTED SOOO MUCH TO LIVE!!! SO HAPPY HE MADE IT.. AND THANKS FOR THE HELP!!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

THxrDcqSh8E,if we all put our minds together and realize as a nation how many animals get slaughtered for profit we can demand change and we can save more lives and one day realize meat consumption isn't a healthy way of living.

GOpFbxlKQGA,I love this  she has such a great relationship with her "cool dad " lol. What great advocates for veganism! I would've given that burrito a bit at a time to a dog though and not thrown it in the trash...I'm weird about that  see throwing in the trash as just as sad as eating it  but that's just me.

GOpFbxlKQGA,I couldn't agree more with her.  I didn't know she was Vegan until now and yes for all of us who care and do not voice our opinion we are in a way saying we are OK with the way society treats animals.

0ia5kLbRz9I,Couldn't watch more than a few seconds  too heartbreaking. That millions and millions of innocent beings are subjected to the same horror every day is just too much to take. Thank God for Farm Sanctuary and other reputable farm animal rescues that at least some are spared and allowed to live a peaceful life.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,So so glad the plight of these farm animals is being brought to people's attention more and more  it just can't go on something has to happen and I hope it will be in my lifetime  I want to see these animals live and be treated the way nature intended...Thankyou so much for being a voice for them.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,Animal welfare = animal abuse. I don't support this because it supports the idea that if they treat the animals better before the send them to be murdered  them it's ok. It's never ok if they're being used. I don't like that the farm sanctuary is supporting animal abuse (supporting animal.welfare is supporting the use of animals).,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,killing is cruelty...... this a step in the right direction but we need to fight for is to make animals sentient beings on paper rather than products and possessions.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,love love love!  You guys are the best!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,YES WHERE DO I VOTE?! (I don't live in California but I hope New York and the entire country gets behind this soon.) Animals deserve to be animals  even if they are food animals  let them live as they naturally would while they are alive. Otherwise  we are not as superior of a species as we thought we were.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,California is always one step ahead. Sorry  I hate the US  but not California. California has always been special.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

_V-pIhqTm4o,Morals is everything !,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
_V-pIhqTm4o,What I worry about is that the supermarkets will then buy from other states where horrible practices still go on - the MOST IMPORTANT thing is not these ballots but for CONSUMERS THEMSELVES to STOP BUYING tortured meat and ONLY SUPPORT local farms where they can verify that animals are raised more humanely themselves. You can't just expect the politicians to make everything right for you - YOU GOTTA do it yourself. You have to personally make sure that you don't buy tortured meat.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

1_Su4emVhWY,She is so beautiful  i had a major girl crush on her in the 90s,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,I ve tried to be vegan but i have very low tension.Very dangerous. This vegan thing is not for me.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,his teeth ...no milk?no calcium? OMG :(,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,I am so happy that she just hasn't changed a single bit. Her smile  the way she raises her eyebrows----She's as beautiful as when we first saw her.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,MILF.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,She has been one of my favorite girls  even way back when the word "Vegan" was alien language to me. I guess that  somehow  I could read her energy  even if I didn't speak the language!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,"YOU WANT NACHOS?  IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID to ME?" >(,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,Give the kid an pastured organic grass fed steak,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,im interested i want to try vegetarian but then i want to go straight vegan im american living in egypt how can i substitute for things i cant find,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,I thought Bear was a girl!  Sure looks like one.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,i don't try to be mean but is her daughter a bit slow?,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,Fuck all these famous people names there kids dumb shit,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,Adorable mommy Alicia and her adorable son Bear.  So Sweet.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

1_Su4emVhWY,1:03 Cher lives,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,only rich people could afford to be vegan...and its kinda wrong to force a kid to be a vegan...why not let him be normal and decide when he is older...and vegans are annoying  they cant control themselves to lecture you about vegan stuff,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,Wow  he looks like her!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,omg i thought it was her daughter,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

1_Su4emVhWY,They are both adorable.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,For all the people making jabs at her child  you're despicable. Most children behave this way at young ages. They have short attention spans  say silly things  make silly faces  & sometimes forget their table manners. Stop being so mean to kids  especially when you're not even parents.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,SO CUTE!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
1_Su4emVhWY,(y),farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

1_Su4emVhWY,Bear looks just like her!! I love this so much  what a cute Mommy and Son duo <3,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
gE5M5hNKqbY,your right  I wish people could like her,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
gE5M5hNKqbY,She is adorable,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
gE5M5hNKqbY,I absolutely adore Mckenna Grace  not only as an actress but as an animal activist. We need more people like her in the world. Animals are beings with feelings too  more people should treat them with love and respect. :),farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
gE5M5hNKqbY,Dragging an eleven years old child in front of the camera to get a message across is just wrong  imo. This doesn't change even if the message itself is noble and the child is a "star".  I'm saying this as a vegan who supports you guys otherwise btw. Kids can make conscious decisions; no doubt about that. Just don't put them in front of a political  religious or ethical bandwagon.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

QucZjGY7Mv8,I love you  Gene. Thank you.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Whenever I have a Fleeting Moment of thinking  "being vegan is hard " all it takes is reflecting on the environmental justice aspect of the matter  as represented here. Not to mention the animal ethics part. I simply CANNOT support the meat and dairy industry  knowing the things I do now - and seeking out that knowledge was scary at first  but damn am I glad that I did it. I hope more and more people can be brave and do the same  too.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,How sad  what we do to animals. I pray for better outcomes for animals and people. These poor animals are at the mercy of the most vicious animal ever...humans. Shame on us  when we lose our compassion and empathy  we will cease to exist. I hope people see this and stop eating animals.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Jimmy Dixon owns a turkey farm  he is also in the pocket of Prestage Farms! Vote that human shit stain out of office!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Stop eating meat. Put an end to this. Hard to believe all these people whining about CAFO's are still eating MEAT!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,I know that smell - been outside Smithfield protesting for the pigs a few times and I know that smell.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,I have always wonder why the water was pink  I have seen that looking down in a Aeroplane. I am Vegan  and had no idea that the waste was being sprayed over towards home only into lake. I love that the community has come together over the abuse of animals. I am so sorry these people have to deal with this. No only is this from Pig but they also do this cows as well,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Wow,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,People need to see this  thank you Farm Sanctuary.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Sorry  I spelled wrong  :disgusting,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Diskasting human beings  !They destroying  everything !Killing millions of animals and killing human beaing but very  slowly !Animals live in misery but not to many people care about them !!Some people deserve to die suffering and may God forgive me I don't feel sorry about them !Because all that care about is themselves!Shame on some human being!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,We have to stop these excessive amount of Hogg farms...stripping the forest...and over development of out Tar Heel State...if we don't do it...who will?,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Love your organization. So thankful you are out there. Did a Toronto Pig Save vigil. Everyone should do one of these vigils to see for themselves what these poor animals are experiencing.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
ZFzDpUUecw8,Animal ag is devastating for humans  the environment  and of course the animals.  When you purchase this industry's "product" you are paying them to destroy the earth and torture animals. Please try vegan.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

H5B1RMxMm2Y,Susie   The world is a better place because of people like you. You are so wonderful!!!!!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
H5B1RMxMm2Y,That was cute!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
H5B1RMxMm2Y,my doggo freind made me understand what you said 2:15 even though I never really had any relationship with farm animals I watched lots of videos about them and I just totally understand that it's true... many thanks for what you do,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
H5B1RMxMm2Y,You compassion for these animals is really amazing!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
H5B1RMxMm2Y,Hi Susie  I don't mean to put you on the spot  and I hope this question is not too personal but  I was just curious to know what you meant at 3:00 minutes into the video  when you said you were trying/hoping to live more compassionately in general  and that you weren't 100%. I know it's pretty much impossible to be 100% vegan  for instance  I struggle to cohabitate with bugs (I live in Florida) and I still use an antiperspirant deodorant  so I'm not perfect and I try to be the best 'vegan' person I can be but it's a real challenge living in a non-vegan world. Would you mind sharing? Oh  and just so you know  I really love you and Farm Sanctuary. You inspire me. Working at Farm Sanctuary is my dream job. Thanks :),farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
H5B1RMxMm2Y,Susie you Rock  your love for them !I hope to get to visit some day  its on my Bucket list !!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

W0H1wam9qtU,Nobody X2 lol.. thanks I was so educated just now :) It really makes me sad.. and I was amazed they don't spat pills out which my doggo friend wolud do lol I always thought farm animals would feel uncomfortable with their body especially for dairy cows... It's not like antlers or gigantic natural muscles of buffalos It has no use for them :( It only makes them feel uncomfortable when they run which is what they love to do,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
W0H1wam9qtU,I love these cuties! <3,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

eEHUtoQPdf4,I understand the not killing part  but I don't get the not drinking milk and not eating eggs. Could someone educate me on it's bad to have any animal products (even if they are ethically sourced)?  I could easily give up meat tomorrow  but eggs and milk would be hard.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Wow  what a great video.  I came by way of Wavy Carbs' video on Kevin's recent heart attack.  It's crazy to think it was just one year after this video was uploaded.  He apparently is now going to think about adopting a vegan diet.  I wish him the best of luck.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Doomies is the best! Not the healthiest but so yummy. I have taken several non vegans there and they all loved it! Even the ones that wanted to be able to say it sucked.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Is anyone else mortified that the servers preparing the fries were wearing no gloves and just bare hand handled the food.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,I like the way Harley is patient in her discussion with him and not all angry and narrow minded one sided the way some people are who become super involved with an issue,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,I was waiting for obvious Kevin Smith comment "Do vegans eat pussy?",farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,For the record  planets do have nervous systems and can feel pain.  Also regardless of what happened/was said  I grantee Kevin Smith still eats meat.  Never the less  power to Harley for doing what she feels is right.  I may not agree but hey  that's what makes the world go round.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,i'm a vegan and a Kevin Smith fan  so this was awesome!!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

eEHUtoQPdf4,Poison Ivy would be pissed  though.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Thank god something good came out of this Kevin Smith...,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Here is some food for thought.  When I was a teenager  I was a part of a demonstration showing plants feel. A few plants were hooked up to lie detector machines and I stood nearby thinking about pulling a leaf off. The machines registered as if they were in great pain. In fact  the machines showed more pain than when I actually did the act without thought. I assume that their 'nervous system' is more chemically based than ours.  We need to treat all life with honor and respect regardless if it has a soul or not because life does feel.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,there's no way around it: meat is technically murder. bad karma. choose life  kindness and compassion.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,I took my dad to a vegan restaurant in Dallas and he said he would get their (faux) pulled pork again :) He was very surprised and impressed.  Thank you for spreading the word  both of you :),farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Great Dad Daughter vegan talk!!!!!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Love the father-daughter dynamic of this conversation and how open Kevin was to doing this and how calmly and sweetly Harley would challenge her dad's comments without either one being disrespectful to the other.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,I love Kevin Smith  I love Harley Quinn...but I also love meat.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
eEHUtoQPdf4,Vegan profiling lol  I can hear it now. Hey! You that just walked out of McDonalds  fuck you :).,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

QLKxjokQjrk,About 5 years ago  I went to my brother's place for a visit  and we all ordered from a Lebanese place for an impromptu dinner. My brother and nephew ordered falafels whilst my sister in law ordered a lamb wrap. I thought of how  in spring  lambs pop upwards on all four 'spring-loaded' legs; like popcorn popping in a green field...I wished my sister in law would watch videos of the live creatures she feeds her taste buds with. Later that night  back in my own home  I wept for those fun-filled lambs...,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

kOrjbiBxuyk,Susie and all of Farm Sanctuary are saints! They see and deal with nightmares that most of us cannot imagine experiencing  yet they do it  day in and day out  for the animals - not for glory  money  or recognition...just for the precious lives they save.  Thank you Susie and team for saving these darling angels!!!,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kOrjbiBxuyk,I think that the horrific and disgusting things that people do to animal  all animals  is what should be done to them...that should be their punishment for such cruelty.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kOrjbiBxuyk,It's hard to express how much I admire you for rescuing these pigs.  I gave up eating pork several years ago because I could not tolerate what I saw happening to these poor animals.  Thank you,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

kOrjbiBxuyk,Pigs and all animals should never be left to the mercy of those less intelligent than themselves  ie   so many humans.,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kOrjbiBxuyk,Great video,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
kOrjbiBxuyk,I donated when you first rescued these pigs  and I only wish that I could adopt one or two..   The man responsible should go to jail for a long time for what he put these innocent animals through.  Can you please give an update as to the rest of the pigs  did they all get rescued?,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

GyXWDNrjxr0,Brahman cows are one of my favorite breed of cows. A cow I fell in love with  who is a Brahman  is why I went vegan. I see Delmar's soul in every single cow I meet  and I am reminded why I chose to stop eating animal products  and contributing to the cruelty to such sweet souls.

--n3bsMyVuE,There is no such thing as 'humane' animal products.  It's just a term the factory farming made up to fool people into thinking the animals are well cared for.  I'm getting ready to make my will and would love to leave my estate to you.  Is there information about how to do this.  I first thought of the HSUS  but have heard some not so nice things about the president of the organization.  Then I began watching your videos a few years ago and have been thinking about it as I love what you do with the overlooked farm animals :),farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1

MXfx10eaXm4,Thank you so much   guys.  The work you do is incredible and we appreciate you sharing it with us.  As others have said   please post more of these types of stories.  They're heartwarming and life changing in a world fueled by ignorance and cruelty.  For anyone watching who is not vegan   please consider this lifestyle   if you can.  I've been a lifelong omnivore for 52 years and recently went vegan.  It's not hard. I eat a simple whole foods diet   and have fallen in love with quinoa  something I would have never bothered to try were it not for this lifestyle switch.  If you won't do it for the animals   at least do it for your health.  For every animal product you don't eat   lives are saved..and maybe even your own.  xx,farmsanctuary,farmsanctuary1
