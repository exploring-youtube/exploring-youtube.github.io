0LRbMLSvdzk,Enjoying the Fortnite & CoD ww2 videos!! :D,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,It would be really cool if you did a vid with no cam and just did a commentary and talked about stuff. I would watch it and then I would pay for a click farm in India to get it to 60 000 views.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,the amount of people who still dont know about the bus / tree of life amazes me,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,well duh  youre playing with mouse and keyboard  of course youll have a better time shooting than on console.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,You really shouldn't need any aim assist with mouse and keyboard,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Clap Clap,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,why does you web cam look like its in 480p,Hutch,shaun0728

0LRbMLSvdzk,Burst> AR,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Aim assist is for noobs  back in my day all you could rely on was your eyes & your hands and we preferred it that way.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,I know you put one up yesterday but you really should be uploading a WW2 video daily right now. IMHO that is... I'm just a guy at work watching youtube wishing i had one to watch ;),Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Sniping in Fortnite feels like sniping with the M24 rifle in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 I swear. Same range  velocity  drop rate.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Why did you not take the shield at 14:00,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,lmao i thought that was J until half way through,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Hey hutch  any videos with existential topics coming soon? I always enjoyed those  they felt real and not what most youtubers talked about,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Hutch's description of his sniping ability is the same way for me  but for Battlefield.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,really think rockets need a Nerf  even something as a firing delay  so that they don't have an advantage over shotguns at point blank range. I think it's a little ridiculous,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,<3 you hutch.."sit back kick your feet up  and enjoy the fucking video" classic...,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,This game has cosmetics now?,Hutch,shaun0728

0LRbMLSvdzk,*sits back and enjoys the fucking video,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,hutch is a greedy mf,Hutch,shaun0728

0LRbMLSvdzk,You play like a greedy cunt ( I'm not one to judge tho  I do this myself <3 ) great vids dude,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Im just now starting to use keyboard and mouse in this game  any tips on getting better? Its so hard for me.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,Watching you pros snipe is great! People just never stand still long enough for me to actually hit them   lol. Steep learning curve but it's fun playing - and that's all that matters.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,sniping in this game is similar to the older Battlefield games were hitting snipes was so rewarding,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,As a person who's new to BR games (never played one) should I get Fortnite?,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,why do you seem to ignore the ammo boxes? the green military style ammo boxes can be looted like chests for ammo.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,I like when you talk aggressive to me daddy,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,I really like watching you snipe in this game so fucking satisfying,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,The bullet drop in this game is really well done on snipers. I enjoy it too. I look forward to getting better at the game as I only have a couple hours played so far and am relatively new to the genre.,Hutch,shaun0728
0LRbMLSvdzk,jesus 1hp,Hutch,shaun0728

9mQ7aUcXz_o,Next time someone says your being sexist by saying something is super manly tell them " If the Queen had balls she would be the King,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Bandages over rockets in a 1v1?,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Its not as good/bad as the double pump but its good,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Is everyone here okay with how the building works in this game? I personally think it's way too spammy  just curious to know how the community feels about it.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Some people are way too good at this,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Half the time I think my speakers are muted until I hear the game sound,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Even more douchey then double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Great  the new double pump is here.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,hutch? its been a long time my friend,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Well played  you getting better at this game :),Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Did he just say NPR is a reputable source?? Smh He s still bomb at the game tho,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,whaaat????,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Hey hutch  long time fan always loved watching you vids. I was just thinking  I know you talk a lot about politics on twitter but I would love to watch some politically driven YouTube vids from you. (Although I'm probably alone on that one so I don't expect you to  just wanted to share). (:,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,My man.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Has Hutch discovered the new double pump??  Honestly  watching your Fortnite games has inspired me to get better. Still don't think that's translated completely in game yet but we're working on it,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,suprised you didnt say CNN lol,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Absolute madlad,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,didn't pick up the scar or the bolt.... wtf hutcherson,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Do a video of your settings!,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,While the deagle sounds alright  I still think my favorite sounding pistol would have to be the M1911 from Battlefield: BC2. The M1911 also sounds pretty nice in Battlefield 1943 but I have much better memories of using it in BC2.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Glad to see you still banging out content all these years later. Been a fan since Respawn days. Love ya man.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,When you dropped the shotgun at the end it made me think of Black Panther when he loses his power to fight for the throne!,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Nice ending kill!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Fucking epic victory royale celebration,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Those wings really ruined that skin in my opinion,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Nice video Hutch! I hope my content could be as entertaining as yours one day!,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,My god that kill seemed really lucky  unless the eagle can actually be reliable from that range,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,The new double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Honestly disappointed in epic games for not realizing the deagle will be used in the exact same way the pump action was  the shot cooldown timer should be global for the deagle otherwise running 2 is to abusable.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,did they change something with the grass in this game? i feel like it looks so different...,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,sean "probably npr" hutchinson,Hutch,shaun0728

9mQ7aUcXz_o,Double Deagle is insane,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,When u left the scar at 4:35 part of me died insode,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,That does sound heavy. There's an exotic (or legendary  depending on which is gold  I can't remember) scout rifle in Destiny 2 that sounds pretty intense as well. I can't remember the name of it. I do remember that its damage and fire rate goes up when shooting from the hip. Almost becomes fully automatic. Not that great of a weapon overall though.,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Nice finish Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Been going Tac/Deagle and its so awesome :D love it ;D,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Is COD WWII officially done?,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Feels like oma noodtube ... the abuse,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,i love the cs 1.6 deagle sound. thats meaty :D,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Epic fixes double pump so everyone just abuses the bug with other weapons . /sigh cancer community and that includes the youtubers,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,If hutch figure out how to talk more when he does these live commentaries they'd be so much better,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Hutch assuming the gender of the gun. Not very leftist of you. You're uncucking. Jokes  love the vid as always man,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,3 Deagles?! braasss taacticss,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Remember when you said it was trash 2 days ago lol,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Bet they patch that... it's not as bad as double pump but still negates the hand cannon's reload time,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,how on earth does he already have the john wick skin? x(,Hutch,shaun0728
9mQ7aUcXz_o,Great video but you were quite quiet,Hutch,shaun0728

Nl2uUYHCK8U,Too late im committed.,Hutch,shaun0728
Nl2uUYHCK8U,Great vid. You and sandy mesh well. Certainly more entertaining than hearing hex and mike moan for 15 minutes.,Hutch,shaun0728

Nl2uUYHCK8U,I finally got my first Fortnite win today (started 3 days ago on PS4)  I was so hyped and it's because of teamwork between myself and a random. He played decoy using a jump pad  allowing me to flank the enemy team while he was drawing their aggro. I ended up wiping their entire team. ^-^,Hutch,shaun0728

xPiqCZsVR3U,The connectivity on this game's server is just absolutely terrible. After they see me I'm dead in a split second  I can't even aim down the sights or shoot. You gotta have lightspeed in this game to get kills.  It's not bad all the time (I get good scores aswell) but in COD4 till BLOPSII the stability was way better and the difference between good players and shit players was easily noticeable.  Maybe it's my own internet connection  which is not the best there is. But I've never had this problem before  at least not as much as now.  This game COULD be a great COD after a long time but there is just too many shit in it what ticks me off.  My k/d is somewhere between 2/2.7 normally. I'm nowhere near that k/d in this shit game.,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,But more importantly  respect the bish.,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,The M1 Garand is the Base Guitar of CoD guns. It's deep  fat and satisfying to use but ultimately no-one wants to be the one to use it.,Hutch,shaun0728

xPiqCZsVR3U,That was nothing to do with the garand being good  it had everything to do with the enemies being total ass,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,You brought up Bourbon and it reminded me of the time I played a drinking game on NBA 2K with my buddy and I ended up drinking 3/4 a bottle and ended up throwing up all over the place and not being able to eat for 3 days.  Good times....,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,He's not even saying the name of the gun right. Garand. Not GUH RAND,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,The fact that your character has to manually close the bolt after reloading triggers me.,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,Such a good gun especially competing with every nerd using the stg44,Hutch,shaun0728
xPiqCZsVR3U,The Rekage!,Hutch,shaun0728

xPiqCZsVR3U,shits a joke... the garand takes 3 bullets to kill at pathetic ranges and its semi auto with very noticeable recoil... then you have the fg42 that kills in 3 bullets at all range  is full auto and has almost no recoil whatsoever ... what kind of blind fucking monkeys do they have balancing guns at cod studios man seriously?,Hutch,shaun0728

There is a grave yard that has 1million graves because of the disgusting acts of the USA. Lieing to its people and the world say Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when in fact they went in for the oil. Can you be considerate hutch and rename the title please,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,What is your overall opinion of CoD WW2? I know you've been enjoying fortnite a lot but I'm curious if the reason for you ever picking up fortnite in the first place is simply because WW2 never appealed to you.,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,What are your actual thoughts on the actual game though? Was it a hit or miss?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Why couldn't they just bring back the old War game mode from WaW? Why did they have to pass along something else that nobody wants to play,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,My question for you  Hutch: is if WWII is still worth a buy now that we're months after the release? I know COD games get hyped on release but only a few of them have stayed good over time.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  what's your favorite type of liquor? Also as a fellow tall person  what kinds of foods do you stick to to get consistent nutrition? I'm sort of trying to eat more but I need some that's filling enough for my 30 minute metabolism.

J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hey Hutch  with the emergence of BR games such at Fortnite and PUBG  do you think that FPS games will start to take a knock back in terms of the popularity they receive? Personally I hope so  I'm hoping that it will means publishers and developers such as Activision and Bungie will have to work harder to make their games like COD and Destiny better  more cutting edge and stop relying simply on the legacy of a title to get people to purchase and play the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,What's your favourite thing about the new kitty?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,You planning on playing sea of thieves?,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,I hate watching someone try and talk me into a game I know they don't like  a bad game  a game they never play  only because they have an obligation to the advertise for the game when new content is being released? He posted a 17 minute game play and only talked for a minute or so because he has nothing good to say.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,You can tell he doesn't like this game,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,When you're playing games throughout the day  what's your state of mind? Are you 100% involved in the game/gameplay/atmosphere or are you say 80% involved  and the other 20% thinking about other things. I ask this as recently I am the latter when playing games and I struggle to capture that childhood like naivety that we once all had with video games......i'm essentially just curious if everyone is in the same boat as i or if some can zone into that "way of playing"   Thanks  much love x,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  have you ever been lucky enough to have a garbage plate and if not  now that you are googling them. What type of garbage plate would you like to try if you ever came to good ole Rochester.,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,I was wondering when this video obligation would be fulfilled.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  did you see Logan Paul's response video to all the recent backlash? Do you think him donating 1 million dollars to suicide prevention corporations justifies his actions and claims to change  and more importantly... do you buy it?,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,Lol hit markers for days why is the hit detection so bad?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch why no more PUBG? I know why cause I've heard your reasoning in one of your recent videos. However there's been huge updates since the last I've seen you play. Also the last I've seen you play was when you went with OMoO and I believe got a triple or quadruple back to back win with them. Just curious man  keep up the great videos and streams!,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,How do you feel about the game theory that suggests our world  universe  everything we know  etc. is actually just a super advanced alien races computer simulation. Basically the Sims where all the characters have the capacity to think for themselves. I think it's a fascinating  prospect. Very black Mirror  do you watch it?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch have you agreed with anything trump has done?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,I know this is an unpopular opinion but I really don't like the building aspect in fortnight. I do enjoy the game but I think it's a cheep and easy way out of gun fights and makes the game inconsistent. What do you think about a new mode kinda like a hardcore mode in the game  you can't build but you can only have a certain amount of ammo or certain levels( maybe up to green or blue) of guns to help balance the no building. I know I'll get hate on this but it's just my opinion. It would be awesome to know what you think been watching you for years love your suff man.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,have you ever had a threesome? do you listen to rap music? if so who is your go-to rapper? how fast is fast? is water wet? who is worse in cod  hecz or jay? when are you getting married? do you believe in marriage? plan on having any kids? if so how many  and would you name your son Hutch  if you were blessed with one?,Hutch,shaun0728

J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  why aren't you and the OMOO squad playing more WW2? I understand you guys like fortnite but it seems like you guys don't play WW2 at all.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,WW2 is traaaaaaash,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutchy-poo  have you considered going to culinary school? I know you like to cook  and many schools (at least here in Maine) offer two-semester programs to become certified.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  if god creates people and god is omniscient (knowing everything including the future)  which are both claims in the bible   wouldn't this mean that god creates people already knowing that they will go to hell? Thanks.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,What specifically do you like about fortnight as apposed to pubg assuming u prefer fortnight.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  I've been with since prr-machinama days. It's amazing to see you adapt from gameplay videos  to scripted shows  to live streams. Now that you're closing on a million subs  what are your plans for the future? Do you have anything special for the milestone?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,What was the emotional process of realizing that a game that dictated ur professional growth for years had become so bad that you  had to make the decision to Branch out?  What was it Like coming to that conclusion?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Trump  Hitler  Sessions. Marry one  Kill one  Screw one. Go.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Is there any way we can expect any commentaries coming back at all from you? I know nowadays we get little short rants and such  but I kinda miss the days where it was just random gameplay over a commentary about whatever is burning your bacon. And those that don't want to hear your political opinions you could leave like a few seconds of disclaimer or something idk,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,If you had to eat a human cock sandwich how would you want the penis cooked and what condiments would you want on the sandwich.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,What is this cod gameplay? Lol,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Would you rather fuck Nanners or Sark?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Hutch  you ever think about having a hair transplant? You look so much older like this.,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,I know you may not like bringing up politics on your youtube videos but Ben Shapiro made a comment "A poor person in the United States today is living better than a rich person in the 1920s." which I think is completely ridiculous. Do you agree with much of what he says i.e gender dysphoria  abortion etc. Or are you against a lot of his views?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Was there any moment early on in your career that the YouTube "ego"  consciously or unconsciously  directly affected the way you handled yourself in normal everyday life? If so  how did you go about balancing this aspect of your life to the point you're at today?,Hutch,shaun0728
J7GSdWF5Nb8,Deport DACA!,Hutch,shaun0728

2WOXGjYeGyA,Hey Hutch  not sure if you did it already but do you have a music playlist  Monstercat etc of your fav music?,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,You made a video a week ago or two ago asking your subscribers if they wanted to see shortened/edited videos or full length. Most comments were in favor of the longer ones. Will we get to see those anytime soon?,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,love the fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728

2WOXGjYeGyA,Whole new level of respect for Hutch after hearing Run The Jewels at the end.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,It's fun  yes. Does it ruin the game IMO  YES! The thing that separated Fortnite from other BR's was the building  then they add a gun that makes it impossible to build against. 1000 bullets spraying at you  potentially 4000 in squads. They're updating this game into the ground. Also no  I don't tower camp but this thing even makes it hard to rush build on someone.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Hutch  have you heard/seen battalion 1944? It seems right up your alley,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,5:35 Diesel: "There's a bush!" *sound of 3 miniguns firing  Made me crack the fuck up.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,How were those guys eating purple bolt action shots??,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Op as a mother fucker,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,10:25 me yelling at my computer "IT'S OFF THE BLUEPRINT!!!!!",Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,God damnt Hutch RTJ has been stuck in my head since your stream,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Can't wait for you to start producing interesting content again.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Respect for the RTJ at the end Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,An I the only one that doesn't like the fact they put these mini guns in the game? Fortnite is slowly getting more ridiculous,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,And no one watches them anymore,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,finally  thank fucking god  a video displaying the minigun's true potential thanks brother,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Why do you not play with J anymore?,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Yessss...rtj to finish the video. They're the best for my running music.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,That run the jewels drop  and thouse miniguns  goddamn,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Ohh mayn. THA JEWELS!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,What an a-maze-ing ending. Legend.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Run the Jewels? My dawg,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Damn that looks fun be right back XD,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Black Panther outtro hell yes!!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,yeah hutch! run the jewels as your outro!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,watching those bases just vanish before my eyes puts a smile on my face :0,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,When is he going to grow up and stop playing this game for 5 year olds. I used to look up to hutch so much  now he's such a loser. Glass shattering moment smh,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,They should have a minigun only mode.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Good shit man.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,just wonderfull,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Good shit Hutch! Loving the fortnite vids right now bro good tune at the end too  peace and love.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Hey hutch can you watch the video I just uploaded  this is what like is like for console users ... absolute bullshit I feel like never playing again,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Can you make a video of  just quality outros please?,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,hecz in the fortnite shenanigans is the best,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,hutch with the legend has it by rtj as the outro aye,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,I really think the miniguns need to be dropped out of chests much less frequently. A single minigun can already be detrimental to a squad/base  but four is crazy. The fact that there is no counter attack to it kind of ruins the competitive vibe I get with this game. I've been able to get a minigun almost every game I've played since the update which I definitely think is too much. It's a cool idea and can be a great plan B  but IMO the drops are too frequent.,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,American Gangster was so good,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Love these videos. :),Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,And I thought RPGs were already too strong in the endgame,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Run The Jewels for the outro... respect,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Dope outro song hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,I find that solos it can be dangerous because you can't hear someone coming if you're focusing on someone else already in front of you. Definitely meant for squads,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,That run the jewels........,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,hey guys I worked really hard on my latest upload  a fortnite sniping montage  and it would mean a lot if u would check it out Thanks!,Hutch,shaun0728
2WOXGjYeGyA,Thank goodness for hutch...,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,100% should've brought up Diesel being lower than you at the end.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Of course Hutch playing as the black female character with the rainbow flag as his calling card. Gotta go full libtard to try and trigger everyone who wants a historically accurate Cod multiplayer game,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,More,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Kinda funny watching them debate over the connections when they have a monkey's grasp on how the internet works. Hate to break it to you boys but it's still p2p. Your beloved sledgehammer games isn't going to provide dedicated servers for a million+ players.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,This game is awful.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,This is the first time since MW1 haven't picked up a COD so maybe other maps play differently but for SnD (the mode I play the most) this looks like absolute garbage. I've said for a while it was never jet packs or boots on the ground or whatever was the problem. Games like Titanfall prove that done right Jet packs  wall running etc can make a great game. It's that I just don't think the game designers are any good at the COD studios.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Nice mouth fadora fag,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Can you show some of the other maps?,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Dtreats playing again? Thats great. I remember him sniping live on the prestige marathon for MW3. He is a beast.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,The game sucks. Went back to MWR.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,WeAreAss lmao great team name,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Literally the worst game development in the history of gaming. Game is so broken  basic and boring. Not a single thing new to learn or do. This is what happens when devs listen to a community that has no clue what makes a game fun and enjoyable.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Bro i miss your chess videos...long time no chess,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,I love S&D on Gibraltar or sainte-marie-du-mont,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Fucking love what you've been doing with the channel  variety keeping everything feeling fresh,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,the level of competition has improved the bar is getting higher and quite frankly i love it,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,I FUCKING LOVE THESE VIDEOS,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,As someone who use to play COD competitively  that first 2v1 was nasty. Good fucking job man.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Fucking disgusting shot at the beggining,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,I kinda feel like they fucked SnD this year.  Short rounds  explosive damage reduction on small maps  longer plant/defuse time  and only 100xp per kill. Waste of time really,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,3:16 I think this is the first time I've heard Hutch yell and I can't tell if he was actually upset or not,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,WW2! Liked before it started! Happy Thanksgiving Hutch and thanks for the upload sir!,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Hey Hutch  there are a lot of buildings with signs on them. You can use those for call outs. Best of luck buddy.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,You inspired me to start playing gb's. Thank you.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Lol 3:30 - 3:36,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Please play Rainbow Six Siege.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Ayeee  new game  same snappy toxicity! Some things never change ;-),Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Can someone give some advice? So  I've been out of Call of Duty since Black Ops II (wasn't a fan of where the franchise went afterwards)  and am considering betting back into it. Is COD: WW2 worth the money and time investment? Cus I'm deciding between it and Battlefront 2.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Why the fk your eyes look like they popping out your damn head... look in like a straight up meth head,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,yes more of these please =] omoo = best content,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,I don't get why some people thought this game would be good just because it's back to a past setting.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Have there always been score streak rewards in GB's? I haven't played cod since BO1.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,That ACE! It almost makes me want to get WW2,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Hutch I'm sorry but you are way too old to play video games. But I know it's your job so I'm cool. Just looks cringy how you get excited for a kill. Time to retire bro and start a podcast,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Honestly though why do you play with these toxic assholes? lmao I'd fucking kill myself,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Pretty sure a clutch is killing 3+ enemies haha otherwise it'd be happening like almost every round...  anyways nice clHUTCH!,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Hutch screw fortnite. I'd rather see you playing GBs and losing. Keep it up man. Keep these comming  i m sure Omoo will destroy as soon as you guys get a full understanding of the game (i.e weapons and maps),Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Watching you play fortnight is growing on me  mainly because you seem happier than when you play COD. I mean I still want to watch you play WW2 be it pubs or gbs since you're my favorite COD gamer to watch.  Either way  i've been enjoying the streams lately  even if I don't get to watch live.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Man i remember the days where everyone was on Dtreats D... i know i enjoyed it during MW2...,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,beautiful first killcam,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Doesn't it get exhausting carrying hector all the time ?,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Finally,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,This game is ass,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Sweet baby jesus on fire!,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Scump's twitch logo is a turnip,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,this is one of the easiest games to play SnD on  but it's far harder to master.,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,fortni9ht is really sweet too H,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,first time I've heard the bomb timer and all I can think about is "cable car (over my head)" by the fray,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Doing damage through those coils with WWII machine guns. Seems legit,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Awesome hutch I love your videos and content you are amazing!,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Miss the OMOO videos  learning the maps definitely takes time though. Still pushing out great content and have been loving the streams! Keep up the great work Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,You ain't grizz baby,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,GB is hard on this game  right? Havent won a game yet lol,Hutch,shaun0728
92bQd2W6Y70,Looking forward to seeing more of these in the future!,Hutch,shaun0728

qTus0Uy9468,Maybe one day we will see another GB grace the Hutch channel. Until next time folks.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Bruh it's been like 50 years later and you've STILL yet to hit that 1 mil subscribers,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Hey Hutch  I'm circumcised  no Turtleneck Thank you!,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,This game is so ass,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Cod needs to bring in leaning like rainbow six siege,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,BR cod  lol you dont want that to happen. the engine cant even handle 16 people.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Really a great video Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Why be against circumcision? It has health benefits and I'm sure your child would thank you latter in life. It helps hygiene and your sex life. Are there religious reasons to be against it? My grandfather had to be circumcised late in his life when he had GU issues and he hated his parents for not doing it when he was an infant. Honestly never met someone who wasn't circumcised and I feel majority of women think it's gross to have the extra skin. I know you can practice good hygiene but alot of people think uncircumcised = dirty dick and having catherized uncircumcised patients that mostly is true  they always get UTI's and have urinary problems,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,My god  can't they do something new? always a remake of old maps.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Are you still friends with essindees and also are you going to give Battalion 1944 a try?,Hutch,shaun0728

qTus0Uy9468,Jesus pick up a tag.  love the content,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Love these kinds of Q & A,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Fortnite has overtaken cod in my opinion  haven't touched cod in a month at least,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Hi hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Isnt this a reskin of a map in MW3?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,your content is getting very lazy my friend :/,Hutch,shaun0728

qTus0Uy9468,Battle Royale style will be gone in about 6 months.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,"The best teacher  failure is." - Yoda,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,As an older person (no I'm not ancient  just 30s)  The one major thing you said during this video that I 100% think ALL younger people NEED to listen to is "be open to being wrong".  That one simple   subtitle comment is something that will help you progress as a human being more than almost any other tip you could ever hear. It keeps you grounded  open minded and humble  Yes we all want to be correct but fact of the matter is you're wrong  more often than you think you should be. Question opinions   make people prove you wrong   but be willing to accept it when it happens and grow.  Nothing shows maturity better than accepting failure   adapting and moving forward with a new fresh idea ......Even if it's someone else's in that moment.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,used to love playing survival on that map,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,I think the challenge you and a lot of gaming content creators face is that you develop fanbases around the games you play and those fans don't always transfer with you as you decide to play new things. I mainly enjoy your COD content  it's why I started watching you in your early days and I absolutely loved when Old Men of Optic played MW.  Some love your chess days. However I do stick around for your streams even though Fortnite isn't my thing  because I like you more than what you play.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,I have mixed feelings about the idea of changing up Call of Duty. Really  what more can change? They've tried to add at least a mechanic or two in recent games and most people either resisted or completely hated the change (jetpacks  SBMM  or the division system off the top off my head). If they changed Call of Duty too drastically I'm almost 100% positive that people would freak the fuck out  like they did in the past. But hey  it's an interesting thought and maybe they can pull something original and well executed off.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,WE MISS CHESS :(,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,I miss your chess content,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Thanks for posting this  Hutch. I'd love if you'd keep making these from time to time.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,When saying COD should go in a new direction to  "Shake it up" what's your opinion on making it more tactical rather than arcade-y should they take a page out of Battlefield's book to add more squad based elements or try and revamp it for a solo experience.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Hutch  your OG. How did you not realize "at the time" it was a remake?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Wonderful Q&A Hutch  probably one of your best so far. It's awesome when the questions you answer are extremely relevant to my current situation and I appreciate you doing that.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Lol hutch I'd much rather be circumcised. I'm glad my parents made that decision for me,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Is it my phone or is he lagging?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,They should remaster mw2 and mw3 into one game imo,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Modern man fails to make the connection that a life of consumerism is why he gets depressed and feels empty  still dismisses religion.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,IS it just me or does this map look like one of the maps in mw3?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,What a great fucking video. Thanks Hutch <3,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,you should probably put Q&A in the title  in case people aren't interested in COD but would be interested in the Q&A,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,I just noticed that was an MW3 map... Nice? Nah  nah  nah... Nah.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,I think MW2 still holds to this day  i don't see a reason for remaster except for balancing all the shit they never wanted to but i doubt there will be a remaster any time soon  maybe in another 10 years,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Great vid  thanks,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Eric Hirshberg quit,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Just realized I was sitting here watching you play mw3 on this same damn map when the multiplayer first revealed over 6 years ago and almost had an existential crisis.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Hecz just killed me!!! XD,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Is this map the same one form MW3 but in ww2?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Bro check out the cool natural burial pods! They bury you with a tree and the trees feeds off your nutrients and grows off of you. How awesome is that for family,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Q: When you play a capture event like this  is there any team chat/teamwork going on or is it kind of a regular old Pub experience (aside from the skill of the players)?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,the map looks great but 3 new maps is not enough. its barely enough. the current default maps are soo fucking boring and stale. and 3 new maps is just barelllllllllllllllyyyyyy enough to get us playing this shit again. instead of new guns i think they should work on making new maps. THAT WOULD SHAKE THINGS UP IN CALL OF DUTY. FREEEEE NEW MAPS. fuck the slightly different gun variants i have plenty of guns already we need mapppppssssss,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,foreskin is gross though.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,YOO THE BROUGHT BACK RESISTANCE!!!  GIGN FTW!,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Favorite beer?,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,Lmao Hutch  I remember watching you on Machinma and threatening Sark's butthole. I've always watched you cause I'm from Santa Rosa and I was pretty sure you're from Petaluma.,Hutch,shaun0728
qTus0Uy9468,bro great video,Hutch,shaun0728

QCuItjELS50,hunting rifle is the fortnite equivalent of m40 acog,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hey hutch. I wish you would take 2 shields instead of a heal and a shield. Shields become even more rare as the game goes especially big pots but everybody is carrying around medkits and bandages which you can take from people whenever you kill them,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Better get your BO4 hype video out quick or you might lose your activision contract.,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,But are you financially literate? Lol! That was me on stream. Good game Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728

QCuItjELS50,What is a "subscriber point"?,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,You earned all of it Hutch  and you deserve it buddy. absolute great content!  definitely my favorite streamer!,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,"If you build it  they will come." I lol'd.,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,love when he hits those quick sniper shots with the guy running  when he has to aim where he thinks the guy will be when the bullet gets there,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Just wanna say thanks  Shaun... for keeping Fortnite free to play for the rest of us with all the money you're spending on it <3,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,You monster,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Boring vid hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,The fact that you went for mini's instead of 3 big shield potions kind off triggered me  friend,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Anyone else watching these with every breakfast?,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Its there a reason why he leaves purple/gold weapons when all he has are blue ones? (I have never played fortnite so I dont know anything about it  but I thought it was white->green->blue->purple->gold),Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hutch got an NRA add man  maybe contact YouTube?,Hutch,shaun0728

QCuItjELS50,When will we see the Sark & Hutch Seananigans?  _Love your awkward self.,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hutch as a longtime fan I can't explain how happy I am to see you playing a game you enjoy so much.  I didn't think we'd ever see the same hutch from Cod4  but I was wrong the man in front of my may have aged a bit but I'll be damned if that isn't the same grinning Sex Icon.,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Why is Hutch not at 1 million subscribers yet?,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Congrats on the subs!!,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hutch my man just wanna say I love your fucking content and the topics of conversation you talk about on stream. One of the most underrated streamers out there in my opinion in terms of subscriber count. Keep doing you bro,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,add one for the montage  faze up...,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,2 50 shields over minis,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hunting rifle is terrible. Why would you use it mid range when you can have a AR. Long range with the bolt is deadly. The guns theyve added are really bad. Silence smg  crossbow  hunting rifle. They are all pointless. I love the game but don't purposely put in bad guns in the game so they wont destroy it.,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,I MISSED 1940?        I'm fucked,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,360 to end it love kt,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Just linked my twitch prime account last month and have been enjoying the streams although i've been watching the YT channel for years. Was pretty pumped to be watching yesterday when you hit 2000 and that split second hunting rifle shot with Sandy was incredible. Congrats on the growth and keep killen em!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,I agree hutch the hunting rifle is inferior to the bolt but it is a lot more fun to use. Thanks for uploading hutch u inspired me to make my own vids!,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,I have been digging the hunting rifle  pretty decent mid range up close,Hutch,shaun0728
QCuItjELS50,Hello frendos!! Well done on the subs man  I'll be renewing mine anyway :),Hutch,shaun0728

zh8OtwZCtTM,I know he was joking but that comment about Cormack was pretty shitty nonetheless. He is giving him a monetizable sub and his response is indifference like he doesn't need his fans,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Hector straight ducked that question,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,9:40 I pulled the same time you did. Our vape cycles are synced up  Hutch. You know what this means.,Hutch,shaun0728

zh8OtwZCtTM,Can you find new faces for your thumbnails pls OMEGALUL,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,really loving the fortnite content. I don't even play the game,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,I played fornite for the time yesterday  both solo and squad. Have to say  while it was fun  I didn't think it was anything to amazing. The game didn't seem as fast paced I thought it would  it was fun  but a lot of the time it was just running for ages  trying to find people  finding no one  and then dying. The loot as well was just never great as well  got 2 maybe 3 purple weapons in several hours of playing  never anything to exciting.,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Hutch i am sorry for my little patience  please forgive me,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Fuck you,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,FUCK HECTOR HE THINKS HES GOOD,Hutch,shaun0728

zh8OtwZCtTM,thanks for reminding me to grab a beer,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Super bored of the Fortnight content tbh,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Although Hutch is definitely Leagues better then myself in execution he still has a few more basics to solidify more consistent wins. Walls Behind every stair when building high to gain high ground was something that I saw almost 0% of the time during this gameplay. It's super crucial to make your stairs as hard as possible to destroy but his insane accuracy makes up for it since whenever they peak you absolutely wipe them. Only other issue I could see consistently was the speed of which he builds. He is definitely fast enough but it also could be done faster and the faster you are at it the better the results will always be. I'd say the fastest builder (while still remaining accurate with where they build) is 72hrs. That man can build faster and more efficient then any player that I've watched. Still really great stuff here. I imagine with how well Hutch plays the game currently he secures more then enough wins to satisfy but I just wanted to give my 2 cents on what I think could be done better.,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Completely fucking standard!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
zh8OtwZCtTM,Keep up the awesome content love to see ur hillarrious reactions and destroying kida,Hutch,shaun0728

zh8OtwZCtTM,Hutchie  I think its only fair criticism from your community that maybe once a week you start adding in different content again. We love FN just as much as you do  just some food for thought to spice it up?,Hutch,shaun0728

iIBFmREKwXU,Hutch  your audio is full of plosives and sibilance (wind-noise from "P's" and "S's"  respectively). Consider a beefier wind-screen on that boom mic of yours  if this matters to you. It's especially noticeable  and quite harsh on the ears IMHO  in the intro.,Hutch,shaun0728

wbxFlKzmUYY,This video is the first in which i actually grabbed a beer! And it was an enjoyable experience. Thanks Sean,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Why don't you just a short delay on your stream bro?,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,I would love to see him drinking a miller lite one day instead of all the weird beers. ;),Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Dead silence should not be a thing in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Hutch says grab a beer. Ima grab a beer.,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Lets go old men,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,no hecz. glorious.,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Im sure a lot of World War II soldiers liked to jump-strafe while hip firing during firefights. The popularity of COD in this day and age boggles my mind  but then I remember Trump is our president and Mumble rap is the soundtrack to our lives and I wonder if humans will make it.,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Great game Hutch  but why does the game change so much when hector isn't playing with?,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Its a pity you can't LIVE stream with a 5 sec delay (Like TV does),Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Is anyone else bored of this game yet?,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Love the call outs,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Is it weird that I clapped when they did?,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,You nasty blaze you nasty,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,classic bum ass stream watchers,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,hutch told me to grab a beer so i grabbed a beer. I'm 12,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Put a goddam delay on your stream  amateurs #OMoO,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Statue statue statue statue statue,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Thank god they won that  I woulda been upset is some cheating ass stream watchers beat em.,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,It's amazing what can be achieved without Hector being... Hector. LOL,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,more call of duty hutch :),Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,They did just clap at the end. Haha,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Whyy so sexy hutch ahaha gg bro,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,I'm so glad you're posting cod vids again! Used to watch you play mw2 as a kid. Great stuff hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,What do you think about the sprint outs?,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Best intro ever! :D,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Wow... I'm never this early for a Hutch video. I feel special  and yet very confused at what my life is at the same time...,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,Come to the Dock Side  Luke!,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,5:40 bruhhhhhh worst play i have ever seen you make hahaha,Hutch,shaun0728

wbxFlKzmUYY,Sikkk,Hutch,shaun0728
wbxFlKzmUYY,hi hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Just listen to npr..... you'll be solid. Reading all that other shit sounds like a part time job.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,more rants plz.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,A very wiiiiiide net of liberal media. Gimme a break.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Could never stop lovin Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,OMG HUTCH PLEASE PLAY POKEMON THAT WOULD BE SO FUN TO WATCH!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,You should always rant about what you want Hutch. Long time watcher and enjoy your content. Miss the call of duty vids but its only cause i suck at fortnight. I prefer pubg. If you dont like his rants just skip ahead or maybe unsubscribe. No one is forcing you to listen to it. Be an adult. Have a fantastic week Hutch. Keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Loved the rant. Need more Hutch rants.   It seems you read these comments so here's a question: you did a play through of Bioshock (1 or 2) where you talked about depression - I can't find it on YouTube now? Did you remove it?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I dont agree with all of you're political views. I do think its healthy to hear another opinion on matters.  I have even had a new outlook on things through listening with an open mind. But I 100% come for the fire gameplay!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Good for you hutch.   Be who you are and if you aren't like by some  so be it.  I encourage all of your viewers to do the same.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Da fuck was that ending lol that was brill,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Amen brother!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Gotta say  my buddies and I hang out in discord and just talk world views and opinions probably once a week. We all have vastly different opinions on the world and politics  but that makes it all the more enjoyable to be able to understand and dissect their point of view of the world. If a person is not willing to at least consider or look into another's opinions  it usually means they're not comfortable with the fact that they may possibly be wrong.  Good on you Hutch  keep being and doing you.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I like how the right deemed the left snowflakes  but get their panties in a bunch when someone else comes with a different point of view (snowflakes)....should I mention all their boycotts? They talk about being open minded but can't open their minds in a discussion.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,You should listen to TYT too then,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,18:55 he left the golden sniper?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,WHY THE FUCK YOU LIEING WHY YOU ALWAYS LIEING :D xD,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,As someone not from the usa i couldnt give 2 flying fucks about the politics so im glad you put the timestamps in but i do belive your right to speak up if you dont agree with your government/president policys as should everyone in there respected countrys,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Why not make separate videos for the rants or comment feedback? Just leave gameplay video intros be exactly that. The intro to this video was perfect if it ended at 0:21,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,that was just awesome!!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hey  what do you know  I watched the rant and now I'm switching off.  See you on the next vid Hutch ;),Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Trump is a hero.  CNN is fake news.  After CNN and the rest of the media lied to everyone for like 3 months with those fake "hillary wins" polls  I honestly don't know how anyone could still follow it or believe a word...,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,100% support that attitude man  people need to stop being so sensitive..,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch  I like your political talks and I encourage you to do some research on who fomented the Bolshevik revolution.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,i dont think its wrong that you voice your opinion about politics hutch  but i think you should do a little more research before quoting facts and statistics  and maybe even citing your sources. specifically in your video when you brought up trump cracking down on legal marijuana you corrected yourself several times and didnt seem like you really knew for sure what the facts were. i dont really care what you do either way  but if you want to continue voicing your political opinions in videos and not come off as biased or as though your opinions are unfounded  and maybe even help educate people and be more responsible with the information you are spreading  it might be a good idea to cite sources when you spread ideas based off what you read/hear in those channels of information.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,As I wonder through games and channels  I have one from each that I always hold onto because they hold the true to what I  as a gamer  find most enjoyable.  I'll subscribe to other channels  and deal with them to a certain point  and leave in time  but I always have yours to fall back on.  Does that mean I agree with everything you say?  No.  But you've held truer to your craft than anyone else I've seen  and that makes me always come back -- I know why you game  and enjoy watching someone enjoy themselves.  I'm glad you don't pander to the crowds like others do -- it's why I can always rely on your vids when others "jump the shark."  Keep it up  dude.  Or don't.  Your call.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,If you were pro Trump would you be putting your political opinions into your videos? I seriously doubt it. That would put your youtube channel at risk. It's a legit concern  every single media outlet (aside from one) and every social media outlet is ramming extreme left views and fake stories down everyone's throat 24/7.  It's doubtful they come to gaming channels to see the same ridiculous garbage.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,The only that hutch has ever said that pissed me off was 90s music sucks. I was triggered its hands down the best music. Tool nin smashing pumpkins nirvana so many others. Triggered son,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I find it interesting you forgoed the AR for the pistol/bandles,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I always hated this mentality that "[insert youtuber/celebrity here] shouldn't talk about politics"  or "I'm here for the entertainment  not for politics". This is Hutch's channel  he talks about whatever he wants  whenever he wants. He doesn't have the obligation to censor himself just to please people who disagrees with him  if you don't like what he have to say  you can always leave.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hey Hutch do you know politico.com? I really like this page to inform about politics in the USA. Im Swiss btw. but the USA have such a big influence on world politics  I always try to be informed about the state of your country as well. Good video as always  love you man!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Your channel  your content,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,7 min rant......brilliant,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I only listen to you talk and turn off most of the time  when the gameplay starts  cause Fortnite is not my cup of tea.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,@hutch do you ever play with subs? I'd love to play some fortnite with you and also blaze one :),Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutchy the hutch hutch  who do you follow on Twitter for your news stories.. I listen to all your rants and enjoy them and want to learn politics. Thank you!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Rants or no rants  I'm still gonna be watching your videos. Respect my man.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch have you tried PVE? I was really into BR but then I got PVE and I was completely hooked. It's really really fun. Not as competitive so you may not like it as much but it's a good tine,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Voicing an opinion on politics doesn't change politics  I'm in UK and none of what I'm reading makes sense because it's a different country which doesn't affect me. Vote who you want as an individual  not based on what people around you believe in. The rant will just create more bias.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,you are a cuck,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch  been watching you since MW2. One of the reasons I liked/like your channel is this talking about random  topical subjects in your commentaries. I've developed opinions since I first started watching you  and even though I don't agree with you on some of your more political videos  I still enjoy hearing a different opinion on it. Keep doing what you're doing,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,My god  you exposed him at 2:10. Fuckin savage hutch  tell em what's good,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I'll start off by saying generally I don't agree with your political views and most of the time don't enjoy listening to you talk about it. But like you said this is ultimately your channel. I do thoroughly enjoy watching your gameplay. A suggestion would be to change up the format of your videos and put your political views or other rant of your choosing at the end of the video much like RhinoCrunch with his religious stuff. Just a friendly suggestion as I do sometimes listen to your political stuff on occasions.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Fuck yeah hutch! Do whatever the hell you want. You be you bro. And I'll be me  continuing to watch.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,That left thumb gets a lot of work when Hutch plays fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Glad I could help  Hutch. Lol,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Anyone know how to switch weapons to the left?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hit them with reality. Haha Some people need to get told that,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Successful troll was successful  that guy totally roped you in hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I enjoy watching the videos.  Listening to them can be a little tedious since we differ politically.  I do enjoy listening to just how wrong you can be and am sad that I've been too busy to catch the streams lately.  But damn can you murder people virtually AND are so handsome while doing it.. I love it.  Beautiful beard  shave the head.  M.A.G.A.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch I don't have any problems with any rants or anything like that but when you call this gameplay "Fucking nuts" and then you end up with 14 kills most of them done with either the silenced pistol up close or the rockets none of which seemed to spectacular to me and then you still lose that doesn't seem "fucking nuts" i mean you only hit like one snipe shot. Was you losing the Nuts part?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I actually look forward to your videos because of the discussions and rants... #teamhutch,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Get it Hutchinson! I've been here from the beginning and I haven't seen a damn thing change. Keep it up  you do you boo!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch  as someone who watched you over 8 years ago when I was only 14  I've really entertained your videos and now your streams. I know many young people follow you and I'm glad you've always been open to discussing politics  which is great! You're at least opening up these kids mind to politics and getting them involved  if they form opposing opinions  great! If they think the same way you do? Great! I personally love your political streams. Keep doing you  hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hey man I enjoy your content and I respect you a lot for telling people like that to essentially "fuck off." Keep up the good shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Unsubbed. Tell us the comments don't run his channel yet a comment spurred 7mins of meaningless content. Wings does this and it killed his channel.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Heres another suggestion. Buy a $3 note book  and write down the names of people who make suggestions.  But purposely forget this suggestion however  for the humors sake. Thank you to the dude who made the suggestion for time stamps.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Clearly Drumpf's attempt to discredit CNN is working to the point that certain people believe nothing they hear on CNN. This is dogmatic hysterical lunacy. This same person probably tunes into Sean Hannity and thinks he is wallowing in the truth. The fact that so many of my countrymen have chewed and swallowed this poison apple without questioning why it tastes funny  confirms that we have the President we deserve.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I don't agree with u politically but anyone that gets triggered by differing political opinion is a a pussy. And I enjoy your commentary regardless.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch  I love you.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Whoever skips over the rants is a cumtarter,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch you look like the biggest pacifist. You must be like 130 lbs soaking wet.  no lie but my girl would fuck you up. She squats 225lbs. Stop going on like you're some tough guy. You ain't shit,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch YOU ARE THE FUCKING BIGGEST..... Best YOUTUBER EVER FUCKING HONEST FUCK TROLLS,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I wish Hutch would spend the whole time of every video talking about politics and other topics he likes  but life isn't perfect. Love you dad.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I don't agree politically with Hutch on almost anything.  Don't care.  Its possible to be friends and certainly to be "entertained" by someone on the other end of your political spectrum.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Rant was great I completely agree. Keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I don't think you and I could disagree more politically but I've been watching you since forever on one of my Youtube accounts or another. I come here to listen to the things you have to say because I respect what you have to say and your right to say it. What kind of person would I be if I knowingly put myself in an echo chamber? Keep doing you  as I know you will.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I personally am not into politics  which may not be the best thing. but with that said I come here for the entertainment and I dont really mind hearing your take on current events because it fuels the conversation and gives a pov on topics.  keep up the fortnite gameplay. most fun ive had in a while playing a non COD or sports game.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Oh god  please swap Daily Mail for The Guardian :( Daily Mail is easily the most hated newspaper over here in the UK and has broken so many rules over the last year and they've gone unpunished for it.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch got triggered by a troll  gotem. ;),Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I honestly love the beginning video talks. It's what I look forward to every video.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch as to the opening rant.. I think you opened the barrel on this one. When you started regularly uploading again You said You were chaning the dynamic of the channel and that what you talked about would be open to discussion.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,I have been a follower since long before the Machinima days. I agree with Hutch  with any topic of politics or topics with opposing stances you should never only consume one side or surround yourself with people whom are for one side. You should always engage in civil conversations and learn the facts of both sides. Not with intentions to be forced to a different stance or opinion but to be educated on whats going on in the world.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Fucked up that end game play pretty badly there ;),Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Wide net of outlets!! LOL! NOT! You don't watch FOX. Its very obvious. You watch CNN and MSNBC. Both left wing garbage. Stay away from politics. Nothing good comes from it for you or anyone watching.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,You're one of the YouTuber I can just watch and listen to and not use as background sound. You're pretty cool and keep up the great work  Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hey Hutch what's your opinion on psychedelics?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Whats the Noob count on PC these days.       cause this is nonsense,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Keep doing you Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Never change Hutch. I have been a fan for years and while I don't agree with everything that you may believe  I respect your opinion. I always enjoy the political rants and any of your deeper vlog videos. Like you said its a good thing to listen to both sides of a discussion.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,did you move to Canada yet  you focking fraud?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,What? Not a young Turks fan?!?,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Video idea  maybe a political q&a? Just recording you and or gameplay? I dunno,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,He listed CNN twice! Confirmed CNN shill,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Been here 10 years hutch say hi,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Nice rant. I'm about as far right as they get  but there's never been a time even during the last election cycle when I wanted to stop watching. It's increasingly important in the world we live in today not to fall victim to living in an echo chamber and I think your  willingness to read that comment shows that you don't.  People who can't stand your bias probably don't understand their own. Which means they just aren't as far along the path as they think.,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,do your thing Hutch. Been watching since almost a decade ago. love your shit then and now,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Nice to see that you acknowledge differences in opinion  and offering them an option to skip the parts they don't like  while still doing the thing you want to do. Living in Sweden  I'm not personally all that into everything that happens in the U.S  but I think you often offer an honest and well argued view on things. Also  pretty much every American (even the lefties) seem pretty right-wing to us over here...  Anyway  great to see you accommodating everyone who likes your gameplay! Keep 'em coming!,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,*pause at **1:49* Hutch is going to tear you apart for this dumb comment. *Resume*,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Standing your ground.... Good for you Hutch  good for you man. :),Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Hutch I love ya man  but.. At times the super left views are annoying. Given  it's your channel and you can do what you want. Just my opinion,Hutch,shaun0728
-MNqexxS5SU,Nice telling these trigger happy kids to fuck off hutch i don't agree with you on a couple things as I am  more conservative but I appreciate your thoughts and damn you're getting super good at this game!,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,I don't think anyone understood the Ex Machina soundtrack reference haha,Hutch,shaun0728

m3aqAOzbpTA,This is one ugly ugly dude,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,Did Ben show up,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,started watching when i was 11  just turned 20. i've always enjoyed your vids but i gotta say my favorite part is just hearing you talk about shit. pretty much any topic is fine  but politics especially. you clearly put a lot of thought in to what you believe and say and i have always tried to do the same. i disagree with you on a certain issues  but i relate a lot to you and your story and its great to listen to someone that is farther ahead on a similar path that im walking. i think you're a sick fuckin dude all around  and i would love to hear more from you. love the fortnite vids watch em all but it would be super cool to see a political rant vlog every month or something.,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,When Hutch started rapping Shimmy Shimmy Ya my love for him increased lol,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,Purple tac shotty???,Hutch,shaun0728

m3aqAOzbpTA,Your voice is a gift from God,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,That final kill was impressive.,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,those lasts 3 guys were the perfect example for why fortnites late game is an absolute joke 90% of the time. Just no-skill campers trying their best to not engage in any way...i hope epic will force a more aggressive meta in the future...,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,"Hello friendos" Hutch's Spanish coming out,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,Hutch  you humming "Your Time Has Come" by Audioslave in this video? Cause if so  you're more awesome than I thought.,Hutch,shaun0728

m3aqAOzbpTA,shag me,Hutch,shaun0728
m3aqAOzbpTA,Hey Hutch  been watching a long time  I suffer with anxiety issues and these videos are a great escape from that and help me forget about it for a while  thank you for everything you do and keep up the great work! Big love <3,Hutch,shaun0728

qLoftDhUtU4,This is sex,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Personally  I like the videos where it's just pulled from a stream  but mostly if it's an exciting game. If the game as a whole is interesting  then I like to see the whole thing. In my opinion they are exciting if they have good banter if Hutch is playing with other people  if Hutch or others are sharing interesting tactics or strategies in a game  or if the games have a large amount of skill being shown (which is one of the things I like Hutch so much for). I also like the highlights or "funny moments" videos  that highlight really cool stuff that we might not have seen if we didnt watch the stream.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch! I remember when you burnt out back in the day  it sucked to see you go through that and have to step away from Youtube  happy to see that you are putting your life first these days! enjoying the content regardless!  You do you man  thanks for the hours of entertainment!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Who else remembers when the famous 2v1 where hutch played against Colyu and LOLsteveLOL was a new video? Those were the days,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Gustuv cannon is pretty god damn bad  but yeh you're totally right about USS Texas is utter aids as well. In fact half of the maps in this game are terrible  they are also all too close quarters with loads of corners  pretty much making smgs and ARs the only viable option.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I wish Hutch did a commentary for the whole video.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I tell everyone I meet that doesn't use YouTube or hasn't heard of you your "pickle story" it's freaking hilarious!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,7:15 classic CoD they're all getting mad and coming up to fuck hutch's shit lol,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,you and diesel's back and forth trash talking and general competitive nature make these videos and your streams so entertaining hahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I love you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch I've never said anything negative on your video content and  i disagree with you but not with your politics. So I feel weird saying in my opinion  I'm not a fan of Fortnite but  I am happy that it resonates with you  man. Also I extremely enjoy your stuff  every since I found your chess content a few years back.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I hate gustav so freaking much.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I thought Gustav was a decent map. I hate Pointe du Hoc because of a glitch spot I've seen people in.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I don't mind you taking the gameplay straight from twitch but I'd rather you sat and did the full commentary rather than leave it and go to the live game. All I do now is watch the first couple minutes of your videos then stop once it switches to the twitch commentary. I enjoy listening to your opinions and speak on topics,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,wait ... so people are complaining about the quality of this video? i mean if this is a rip the quality is fucking awesome hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I'm not a massive fan of this map.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,i like the map so i can't stand gebralter,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,What is the reason for using all armored division?,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,People don't like it because you can't just stick on an smg and run about like usual. You can't run around with steady aim and just spray. You have to aim and move more tactically and whiny little COD players don't like it when you have to think a bit.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Get any nukes yet?,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hey Shaun  can't be sure if you'll see this or not. I just wanted to comment to say that I'd love to see the kind of content that you made during mw2  because it's what got me into the whole call of duty sniping thing  the guides and tips and tricks  camp hutch  the legendary top 5 episode with Small Beans hitting like 40 shots consecutively with the Barratt. I'm nostalgic for those days haha. But at the same time  your health is obviously the most important thing  and I've just came back to your channel to watch you play ww2. I've been watching you on and off for 8 years. That's insane man. Anyways  just some thoughts from a random guy on the Internet. Thanks for the awesome content over all these years.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch - I love that you're doing what you love. COD vids  Rocket League  PUBG  Fortnite - everything. Keep it up  man. You do you. Your personality is what has brought me back to your channel since Modern Warfare 2 days  not how polished your vids are. Best wishes to you  your gf  and your cat. Keep living that happy life!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,USS TEXAS is not a bad map in my opinion,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I agree that USS Texas is a pile of shit. I don't mind Gustav as much cuz I can flank around the sides but USS Texas is just a spawn camp shit show.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,that gameplay was insane  but that kill of the game was glorious....,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,dude it's ok to ask for help! you sound like you have to explain yourself lol,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,It's all about london docks bro,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,i can't put a finger on it  but you've lost your edge hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,i love gustav cannon!!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Why did they choose to have such low player counts in the gamemodes for this game? Its a boots on the ground game  I remember in MW2 domination was like 8vs8  but in this game its only 6v6 if you're lucky.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,just do what you want with your videos...i ll watch any,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,HATE this map,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,The only map I really dislike is Flak Tower.  Too much clutter.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I actually really enjoy both Gustav and USS Texas. I guess I am so focused on enjoying the game that I really have not even noticed a map I did not like. This is the first time I have actually enjoyed a COD  and I noticed that when I enjoy games  I rarely play a map I dislike.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Gustav and Alaska are great for sniping. The spawn trap potential on Alaska is maddening though. Silent footsteps in the mountain class are godly.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Epic!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I actually enjoy USS Texas. But I cant stand Gibraltar. Its the worst map in in the IMO. Gustav isnt very good either.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I would love to help with graphics,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I kinda dig Gustov  I can post big numbers with a sniper. I also dig USS  loving those long lines of sight,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,All the maps are bad honeslty. They all kinda feel the same  it feels like ONE person made all the maps. Bring back maps like Castle. One of the all time greats,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Eyyyy  I am so happy that this game came out  I remember as a kid about 15 years old watching your MW2 videoes after school  this is the first cod I have been able to enjoy fully since black ops 1 so hyyyyyyyyyyped,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,"I'm super busy I have a wife and a cat" ahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,the uss alexis texas does suck as well but you can get behind snipers with a supressor and thats kinda fun,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I remember hutch with the lip rings,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,can this mother fucker just get 1 mil subscribers already,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Diesel whines alot,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,That map is aids. They need to delete it from the files forever.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,you're  such a beast at this game :o,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch just Shat on them lol,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I think the reason people don't like Gustav is that it almost forces you to snipe. I mean you CAN run and gun  however you're going to get lit up by snipers. Hence the reason why I say it almost forces you. USS Texas is only good for tdm and kill confirm  any other objective games it is way too easy to spawn trap. Also spawn traps. My least favorite map now is Ardennes  the spawns are jacked on that map.   As for the YouTube thing. I understand the life thing  I got married recently and have stopped doing some of the things I like doing to do things I love doing with the wife  anyone that gripes about you having a life should quit complaining and go try to find something to enjoy in theirs. Now for my 'complaints' if you want to call them that. The thing I miss on your YouTube is the conversation  if that makes sense. Your videos used to be back ground to you talking about whatever was on your mind  or you were talking about the pros and cons of a game  or where you thought a series(like cod) was coming up short  or you were just having a conversation with somebody else. And they were engaging  sometimes made me stop and think about the topic you had just discussed  other times they made me realize my opinion on something may not have been as concrete as I thought it was.   And all your games with Seananners and Sark are still some of the funniest videos I've ever watched. They came from back when you seem to have enjoyed the YouTube stuff more  before you got burnt out. As for the ripping content from twitch  a lot of people probably come from twitch and might not like seeing the same stuff again. I for one was there for most of those fortnite highlights when they happened and the editing quality made me bust up laughing from how good it was.  Anyway  rant is over  take this as you wish.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,good  work wiht an editor  get them to edit ur game plays  like full matches of fortnight are too long with plenty of empty content where not much is happening we dont need see to just tighten it up and give the story of the game a good pace,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Gustav is a weird map for me. Sometimes it's really fun and sometimes it's trash  it really depends,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch  not all of us have time to watch your twitch streams so I appreciate seeing these highlights. We remember the dark days of hutch leaving youtube for a while and if we had known you were unhappy we would have understood. You do you buddy  we love you and your content. The fans who have been with you  will always be with you. Having said that  if you ever want to make another one of your classic montages  I would not be opposed.  'Pinktage' is still one of the greatest things I have  witnessed,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Gustav and Texas are two of my favorite maps  maybe I'm too big of a camper,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,gustav is aight  pointe du hoc is my most hated map,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I kinda would like an old school cod montage from my boi Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Just stay happy and healthy @Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Honestly this game has the shittiest maps of any shooter game I have played.  Gustav Cannon is the worst map in history and USS Texas is a close 2nd.  Come to think of it the game itself is pretty bad.  Can't play a single game without people lagging around corners and killing me before I even see them  but I can throw in any of COD game and it plays like normal....   Sledgehammer is 0/2 in COD games.  Drop them and make Raven a FT developer.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,hutch I need OMOO. I need it. My balls are shrink...ing Love you <3,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,i love gustav cannon  i always do so well. definitely need a sniper tho  but i got a gold kar,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,That was some good shit,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,hutch your videos are fine they are polished enough,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch  i thought you put your videos on the internet.....not the inner net,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Honestly  can we get a London Docks 24/7 playlist? It is by far the best map.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,My issue isn't the polish of your video  more than you rush a quick 3 minute intro then just leave us with the gameplay. I'm sure that the majority of your subscribers tune in to hear your thoughts and personality. Personally I click off the video once you're done speaking because I don't really want to watch a quite frankly dull above average gameplay with no commentary. Not hating just letting you know my thoughts :).,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Shout out to hutch! Even though I haven't seen every video I've been subbed since MW2/BO1  and always have respected your views on CoD,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Seems like most people are absolutely terrible at this game,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Loving the vids hutch  awesome gameplay. I'm so bad at this game. I just can't get my aim right! Seems harder compared to previous cods,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I'm loving the full length twitch rips  I prefer them to edited clips. What you're doing now is perfect for me personally. Also I love the gustav map and sniping is a lot of fun and very satisfying,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I can't hit anybody with a sniper on the Mountain Division  but find it far more consistent on expeditionary with a stock pocket enfield. Especially at medium ranges,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,That Wu Tang reference had me in stitches :D :D :D :D,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Do you hutchy boy! Those chopped of gameplays are great! Retired Respawn at 1 mil?????,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hey man  I don't think these are lazy. I usually can't make your streams so this is me getting a chance to peek into you just being you on stream. This pure gameplay thing is still you and that's what I tune in to see. Not an edited montage lol,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Hutch your the man!! Keep up the good work,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,IT FUCKEN SUCKS,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Gustav Cannon is by far the worst map in the game USS texas I don't mind actually  Gustav is the only map I HATE in this game every other map I either love or like,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Dies cracks me up man im glad you play with him,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I have respect to console peasants for using a controller for fps games.. Using a pessimal option for your controls is unbelievable.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Great video Hutch  totally understandable too when it comes to having time for yourself. Keep up the good work!,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Reminds me a bit of the World At War map called Seelow.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I think this is the Wasteland of WW2. But instead of the focal point being underground in the bunker it's on top of the cannon.  Not exactly the same obviously but that's what it makes me think of.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Also  Quality > Quantity. I'd rather only get 1-2 videos a week that are well made rather than 3-4 videos a week that are just 2 minutes of commentary and 8 minutes of stream footage.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I think when people say they want you to put more effort into your videos  they're not necessarily talking about editing. Personally  I watch your videos just to hear what you have to say about X topic. When you stop talking and the raw audio kicks in  I leave the video. CoD gameplay is just CoD gameplay. What makes a video special is the commentary (you of all people should know that).,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Not a fan of Gustav  I feel they could have done much more in those no mans lands that you mentioned.,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,Like if Gustav dumb,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I also dont mind the vids from streams. Like you talking to diesel or OMOO reminds me of my buddies and I shooting the shit and having fun. Keep it up hutch ! Hope your cat gets better too! I have a dog that has a rare liver disease and medicine alone is 75 bucks a month . So I know your pain! But i love the vids hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,I dont mimd gustav cannon but I hate Flak Tower. That map is terrible,Hutch,shaun0728
rZhwcjRr1CY,So is there any attachment/perk that allows you to zoom in quicker with a sniper? Or is that not possible in this game,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,what headset do you use?,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,you should take another look at rainbow 6 its changed alot since the last time you made a video... of course only if you want to,Hutch,shaun0728

KiGf_2SX79g,I love subtitle edits.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,This video is very out of character for Hutch  more of a bandwagon video :|,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,I feel like you said that "like a daddy long legs." part somewhere in some video before. I think it was a respawn where someone asked about fighting sark or something liek that XD,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Great Video Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,great editing <3,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,There are more emotions in this video than my past three relationships combined,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Really liked the change of pace on this one. Cheers to the editor as well  this is pretty well put together  would just advise against zooming in the image for the subtitles.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,7:15 Ahaha fuck.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,4:14 speaks to me,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Why does it look like you play on a crazy high sensitivity in ww2?,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,At 0:10 sounds like Barney from the simpsons.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Are there female soldiers in the single-player too? I feel like that would break the immersion,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,god this was fucking hilarious,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,These edits are amazing. I love the zoomed in funny Hutch faces that you sometimes miss during stream. And I like that some of Hutch banter we all know and love is included here WHILE highlighting clutch plays and fails. Nice job!,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,The edits are good btw nice touch,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,How is the ppsh thrive? It looks insane,Hutch,shaun0728

KiGf_2SX79g,My favorite in the order 1.hutch 2.jay 3.hecz 4.diesel,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,What's going on with the editing these days? Not a fan of the change,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,You can't be called Formal  you suck and have shit reaction time.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Nice video hutch. I was thinking of posting stuff like this as well since I can't manage to string together a match in this game where I don't die 20 times LOL,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,More vids like this. Please and thank you,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,I hate those guys that brag about some girl they finger banged at a club. Especially after they shake my hand.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,These are nice  but can the edit's not focus on you so much? I wanted to see the slow-mo replay of your jump shot  instead we see JUST you  which takes away from the video.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,Filthy Frank cameo/reference! This editor is gold.,Hutch,shaun0728
KiGf_2SX79g,WW2 SnD!,Hutch,shaun0728

KiGf_2SX79g,Ay,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The best call of duty game i played in along time,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,It's a meh game. I appreciate how they tried to innovate but the maps aren't good  the guns are bad  the launch was terrible.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,ha at that title haaaaaaa,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The best cod in years ahhahhaahha. The worse cod ever made.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Poor hutch never played cod1 & 2 on PC dawnville what a map!!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Does Hutch stream?,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Youre wrong Hutch..After 3 jetpacks series from AW to Blops3 dont u think SGH would come out with a modern shooter like mw BOTG with good killstreak..i rather play waw than this shitty game..,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,> Every weapon other than the Bar  STG  and FG-42 is useless and horribly outclassed > Map design is god-awful and promotes heavy camping > Increased regen rate makes the game even slower > Worst hit detection ever  I just don't get how you can say that the gun balance is great when the gap between the Bar  STG  and FG-42 is arguably the worst weapon balance gap of any CoD ever,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Hutch I thought you loved Modern Warfare 2?,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,No... just no...,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Destiny 2 Is the only decent game I've played all year and thats because it's a new experience to me since I'm on PC. It runs fine  the PVP isn't perfect but still fun. This is from a Console centric company making a game for PC that isn't broken or locking content behind a pay wall. Says a lot for the other developers who struggle to make even one aspect of there game any good. Cods unplayable and battlefront went beyond greedy. What a joke of a year for 2017 in the world of multiplayer games.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Game is trash stop eating the COD Cock Hutch yezuuuuuus!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,don't even play video games any more but whenever a new CoD comes out I look for the "It's The Best CoD In Years" video and I love it,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,i thought i BattleF1 was so weal. so i wanted to come back to COD. havent playd since mw4. bf1 is soo much better then this  THIS IS SOO BORING. saving up for new star wars.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Treyarch just needs to make every COD. Fire Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I've followed you since cod 4  great to see you playing a good COD again haha,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Is a good a cod  but black ops 3 tops it,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,In the beta  almost everyone played how they were supposed to. Hardly any camping/shot from behind  playing the obj  etc... now that the full game is out I realized it's not the actual game it's the community. One of the worst communities ever to play with.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Is Hutch playing on PC?,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,It's really weird to hear you say its one of the best COD in years  then watch a BlameTruth video and hear him say the complete opposite. I like to hear both sides of the spectrum. Especially coming from the two (for me at least) "originals" that have done COD content on Youtube for years,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The maps in this game really ruin it for me. You literally get naded and shot at from every direction all game,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,My favorite COD that I watched you play was MW2.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Maps are really bad imo,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The gameplay you chose to praise this game is a 6 man vs a half filled lobby? zzz.. Why not show one of the games with all the flaws and inconsistencies? Ohwait.. that would be counter productive to the praise.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,mw2 had at least 9 high quality really good maps this game has 9 maps as a whole not 1 of them is noteworthy of a high quality map like terminal  highrise  scrapyard etc...,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,3:00 is peak connection problems. Love the game so far except the awful connection issues (lag  servers  lag comp).,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I disagree  this has to be the worst BOTG Call of Duty ever made.  Like I'm honestly starting to think every big YouTuber's just been paid under the table.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Completely disagree with you. This game is absolute dog shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,This is HOT ASS,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,This brings me back to when the cod community was thriving oh mw2 how that game will never be surpassed.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Worst maps!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Hutch can you list your top 5 cods in order? just curious,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Best COD for years isn't much of an endorsement considering the shower of shit that's been released in that time.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,It's really nice to see the CoD community hasn't changed much since I stopped playing lol. So much anger and toxicity,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I hate treyarch with a passion but bo3 is the best cod on the current consoles ww2 isn't good a week in and people are already fed up with its shit and tired of low quantity mediocre quality maps,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Cod 2 Cod 4 WaW Forever the Top 3 since they're no longer interested in making quality games in the CoD franchise since people eat the empty promises up every year. Never fails.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,i dont like the maps in this game the only 1 i like is the 24/7 map  and i like alot of the guns but they feel inconsistent to me like one game they seem awesome the next it does no damage.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Idk if i've just grown up and am more exposed to the community now  but i swear that back in the day there wasn't as much whining as there is now. People have to find a problem with every little thing. I do agree that spawns  servers  and UI is messed up and needs to be fixed. I can perform consistently with all maps  guns  classes so they feel good to me,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,So far I'm enjoying the game too. I see the netcode is still completely funked. I land shots on somebody first I lose the gun fight  which seems pretty lame and doesn't reward reaction times. Last nights update seems to have messed up my matchmaking too so I haven't been able to join a Lobby.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Sorry Hutch but this game sucks dick.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,bo3 definitely isn't a top 5 cod game. it's bang average. cod 4  waw  bo1  mw2  mw3 and bo2 are all far better than bo3. boost jumping is the worst thing ever introduce into cod. codww2 is good but theres really only one wide open sniping map  having wide open maps is what cod4  was and mw2 so good,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Buff shotguns  that's all I want. It's ridiculous that 5% of the time I get a 1 shot kill on the double barrel shotgun. I think the combat shotgun is a tad bit weak as well  just a slight damage buff would go a long way imo. Shotgun players have to play so much harder in this game due to the map designs. We shouldn't lose gunfights in shotgun ranges.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Fuck all you haters! Hitch gets paid to say this shit but I agree! And a fuck load of other people do to so stop bitching and play the game!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The gun balance feels solid except the stg44 with rapid fire seems a little too dominant,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I love it but  I mostly play hardcore where pretty much every gun is viable. If nothing else  I'm just happy that the jet packs  laser guns  and obnoxious neon colors are gone.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,If the games the best the matching making is the worst  can be say 15 -20 minutes between games.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,On PC at least the hit boxes are so trash! I also feel like there are some inconsistencies with the guns like at longer ranges smgs taking less hits to kill than assault rifles... the maps are only meh... also incendiary rounds is aids! Shotguns seem to 99% of the time one shot me  and I have never one shot with them. I wish the time to kill was slightly longer. Outside of that I am really glad its boots on the ground again. However  I would love just another modern warfare!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,We need a commentary with sark and Seananers. We need the old crew back!,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Shotguns are pretty bad  but strangely  they seem to be better when you don't have incendiary shells equipped. after i run out of my 4 incendiary shots i get one shot kills way easier.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,One of the best COD.....Hutch getting some checks from SledgeHammer I see.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Wtf hutch? I surely thought youd like mw2 the most,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Funny how every year they say it's a great call of duty  Ive been a subscriber for years through all the ups  downs everything. and i don't recall hutch ever saying guys this COD just ain't that good. some have no problem saying that 6 months into the game cycle after alot of the subs run out take there word for it and buy the game driftor did that last year. I played the beta the maps were ASS absolutely horrible! I'm glad I saved my money last year and cancelled my pre-order this year. Apparently treyarch is the only people that can make a decent game anymore.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I just don't understand how this is still popular.  It's connection based so if your internet sucks good luck.  Oh and the host migration issues cuz the host can't kill anyone.  NO destructive environment like in batllefield where the map changes  no weather changes.  Same old camping spots  and as others have mentioned shot in the back after spawn.  I'll pass on this remake of the same old thing over and over.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,lots of guns yes but im not sure if its balanced - snipers are far too easy to use IMO  quickscoping issue ( yes issue ) is still here after 10 or so years and not sure why. ( faze hype ) I would like to see more people using the semi auto rifles but they seem no match for the auto weapons,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,This game isn't even as good as Modern Warfare Remastered or Black Ops 3. Inconsistent gunfights  shit maps  1 000 pistol grips  HQ that is empty  orders that can't be completed. On and on...,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Reading these comments give me cancer. "time to kill is too high" "time to kill is too low" "smgs are op" "smgs are garbage" nothing pleases the cod community. I can agree that the maps seem rushed and lazily designed  and the first few days of connectivity issues were annoying  but this is easily the best cod since BO2,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Rather have everything OP? Definition aside  I'm afraid that thinking is getting close to what gets us disgusting TTK's...and that to me is the #1 COD killer. Slower (to a point) is better. I'd rather we all have to work a bit more for our kills  raise the skill gap a little.  So far I can only say I think the BAR needs a nerf  but I haven't really used the shotties or LMG's much at all.   On a side note  I hope they take not from DICE/EA and give the community some free maps to make up for the low starting count. They are earning brownie points with a lot of the community  and they should continue that for a strong COD resurgence.  One more thing  The Race was great! Good job Hutch and all involved :),Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,The best COD in years is Titanfall,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Hey man  been watching on and off since Modern warfare 2 I'm now 18 and can't help but think you've somehow impacted me growing as a person. Always enjoy your opinions and commentary  I think you've really helped me to take more objective opinions on life and I just hope you're doing well as a man  take it easy and much love brather,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Black Ops 3 is far superior to this game,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Cod needs to die...,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Shotguns are bad? The flame shells are op as FUCK,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I feel like the multiplayer content is lacking... only compared to what we've had in the past. The Xbox servers are way worse than ps4 as well. (I play on both consoles),Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Raised $450+k for BO3 and $250k or so for this one. Sounds like CODs dying finally.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,so many pessimistic people here.  If your any good you shouldn't have anything to  complain about.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,From pro scne stand of point it seems only the bar  besides some occasions  is the only option but I trully believe most of the guns are viable. The game as far as the first days is solid. Don't trash the maps ppl  apart from the canon map all others have the classic cod feel  dont bitch about the maps  complain about the number of them  some of the remind me the old days of blops uno. Streaks are kinda meh which is a big deal.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I'll disagree with everything you said. It definitely beats IW and AW. BO3 was way better than this game. It's good  but not great. Nine weapons that are good? BAR is the only good weapon LMAO,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,No it's not,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Idk why they took out ground war,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Everyone complaining about the server issues never played waw mw2 blops1 and mw3 all of those games were unplayable when they launched lol calm down it's the first week of the game being out,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Gun balance: everything is 4 shot kilo. Everything.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,if the maps werent dog shit this would be one of the better cods to date imo,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Time to kill is shit Shoot first die first back in action Subs are weak af Campers galore Nades all over the place Maps are not bad except for gustav cannon  Snipers are everywhere Headglitches everywhere Spawns are shit (this will get better over time though),Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Hutch are you doing SnD competitive OMOO soon?,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,this game definitely has potential  but servers has made it a painful experience. gun balance isn't too bad.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,That's why this game should be fixed  people leave because they get tired of the bs and it ends up 2v6.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Black ops is my favorite. Black ops 3 is one of my favorites. Black ops 2 is my 2nd favorite. This cod is my favorite. FFS hutch...,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Gg.why don't you play on your own and show us what you can do. I'm sure it's easy to dominate in a team. Let's bring back a sense of realism for the average Joe. #fakenews,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,This cod sucks ass. Horrible maps  worst launch in cod history  historical inaccuracies everywhere even in the "100% historically accurate campaign"  the guns sound horrible  they have fucked up some of the reloading animations (I'm looking at you 1903 Springfield)  a cliche campaign (Americans vs Nazis)  boring scorestreaks  repetitive multiplayer  holographic sights  etc. I bet in the next month or two there will be guns in supply drops and people running around on d day with a pink PPSH and a gold outfit. This game is absolutely terrible and is such a disappointment. Glad I got rid of it,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,So what rank did the race get to then??,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,For anyone viewing the comments  dont let the number of negative comments sway you. Usually the people that dislike the video feel much more inclined to comment something negative rather than those who like it. Look at the like to dislike ratio and youll get a better idea of how scummy all the people that dislike the video are lol. You can find them right below me.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Orders are broken. FYI,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,I really really like this game. I've been playing since cod1 (medal of Honor allied assault if you know your history on the devs) but flinch is really bad in this game and it makes me sooooo frustrated that I have to use up my basic training slot to fix it. I'll lose gun fights to thumbless  noobs because my gun goes bananas whenever someone looks at me. It's frustrating but I love this game. It feels great the maps are kinda bad but they still play alright for the most part. I love hearing you enjoying this game it makes me happy for you man. Enjoy your day :),Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,One thing that bothers me is that it seems like you run like an Olympic sprinter,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,world at warblack opsworld war 2that's the order of best cods atleast top 3,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,They ruined search and destroy.. I wish I bought a hardcopy so I could return it it's fucking shit,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Cod 4 is and always will be the best. Remastered was great except for the shitty spawning and wayyy to many camos  calling cards etc..,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Honeymoon phase.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,this is the worst ive ever seen the servers for a COD game itself is great though,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,only complaint I have is having to run prime on everything when there's so many other options. Unpredictable flinch is killing consistency in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Black ops 3 is better than this,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Great game,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,Ww2 is a poor call of duty maps are terrible people just camp or head glitch  servers are bad  something is wrong with aim assist or hit detection and the weapons are boring already,Hutch,shaun0728
4S8w134FTSg,My biggest gripe is the maps. They just don't flow very well. Gun balance is decent  considering what it usually is. Yes  shotguns and some semi-autos are useless but they can be used.  Overall  it seems like it will be a good year and a bounce back performance of Call of Duty.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Love these personal minutes u do before a vid starts! Keep em coming :) *kicks feet up*,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,People think streaming is the dream but a lot of streamers get don't take care of themselves and get depressed and suffer. Even things like just the streaming itself can have downsides.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Let me preface my comment by saying I've been subbed for a couple of years  and always enjoyed your content  including Fortnite. But for this video  what the fuck is this man? I see a 15 minute video where you don't get a kill for 4 and a half minutes. I think not editing that was pretty lazy by your part. Maybe your audience really wants to have these 4 minutes of basically nothing happening  and if this is the case  forget about my comment. Personally I don't like skimming through a 15 minute vid to find the "fun" parts. And it's not like there was banter with your friends or you were saying something relatively important. Just my opinion  I'll still be happy to see one of your videos in my sub box in the future.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Hutch I've watched you since day!  When game battles cod4 was your scene. My favorite streamer!,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,I really like these commentary + stream style videos that have become a consistent thing for you. Glad you had some time off  keep up the great work!,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Great game Hutch!!,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Self care yooo  keep the depressions at bay.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,why would people give you shit for taking a break?  It's okay man   take a break.  people want to watch healthy Hutch.  Not this zombie who's been playing day after day.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Yea Hutch  having fun outside of youtube and streaming is just not allowed. As a matter of fact  I think all of us would appreciate if you broke up with Esme. She's too much of a distraction. I hope you understand ;),Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,TRADE THE FUCKING GREEN PUMP! C'mon Hutch you do this way too many times...,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,god damn it you're good. I used ot be god in games always  but now at 27 I cannot be good at video games. My reaction time is really bad  aim terrible  and even creativity is gone. I envy you dude. It's been 9 years since  I watched you i think. God even if I dig up my old videos i was sick back then  and now I feel so bad everytime I play games. It seems liek you havn't lost any bit of skill,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Hutch is a multi-millionaire he owes everyone nothing.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,If you're happy we're happy!,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,i really hate the endgame in solos... I try to play it like my mans here but I'm not good enough to pull it off,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,You killed me in anarchy when I landed with a pistol and you had that purple scar :'(,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Man  I will be so fucking happy when he is bored of this game. I am so fucking tired of this Battle Royale game craze  especially this one  because it looks like it was made to cash in on the Minecraft age appropriate 13-15 demographic. Give me something MILDLY fucking competitive  not this sandbox bullshit where you get hyped over killing a few tweens.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,You should check out 22 Kings cover of Freedom hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Hutch  I've been following for almost 7 years now. I was finally able to subscribe to your Twitch yesterday morning when you were "intoxicated" XD  you accidentally shouted out my name (McFootLong) to whom you were playing with and then called me a "Good Man" so i couldn't of asked for a better recognition from you ahah.   Anyway i just wanted to let you know that you're a fucking legend and you make great content. Glad you found passion in Fortnite  because Hutch isn't Hutch without passion. Wish you and Esme well brother.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Ayy what was the name of the song at the end?,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Adopt me hutch.  Please like so he sees,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,I need time to do leisurely things......getting drunk and playing videos games (for money) every night is really taxing on ones soul.  While I sit at my 9-5 with constant deadlines that I have no choice but to meet.  Before anyone comments "life is what you make it  you could be a streamer too"....save your words....life is about risk and luck.  I am not ABLE to risk the life I have built for myself  I have a family to support.  Maybe if I was waiting tables like Hutch was then I would be willing to take more risk. I just get salty when I hear people who literally live on their own schedule talking about the importance of relaxing and spending time away from work.  Yes streaming is a form of work in the sense that you can provide for yourself but it is not a JOB and it is only as stressful as you make it.  Be thankful for your lucky circumstances.  As Barack Obama put it on the new Letterman show  there are plenty of talented people in this world  your fortunate situation is because of luck not talent.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,I wish you did more GB's with OMOO,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,I store snacks in my 4skn,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Just started playing this game myself and its made me realise just how good you are,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,voice of an angel,Hutch,shaun0728

vS8W5ip_xAY,Thanks for all you do man!  It's unfair for anyone who spends time relaxing watching your videos to expect you to not also be able to kick your feet up and grab a beer.,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,I was really into WW2 stuff and was hoping for old men of optic  did you give up on the idea of playing WW2? To be honest if Fornight makes you happier i'm all for you don't forcing yourself just curious.,Hutch,shaun0728

vS8W5ip_xAY,Can't wait for you to hit a mill man,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,You build too much and put yourself in dumb situations. The first base you built was really dumb  super easy to shoot a rocket or nade in and you're dead,Hutch,shaun0728
vS8W5ip_xAY,Some Youtuber's post monthly some weekly so when the daily ones stop for awhile or post irregularly I ain't complaining about free content,Hutch,shaun0728

vS8W5ip_xAY,Wait  I'll get a beer and kick my feet up!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I come for the Hutch talks in the beginning of the videos  so edit em however ya want.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full Gameplay would be hella appreciated,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full gameplay please,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,edited  25min+ videos are way to time consuming,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I dont mind full games. I would prefer both.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,If the entire game is interesting then post the entire game  if only parts are interesting then edit it down. I think some should be edited and some should not.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like to see full videos Hutch. A once a week highlight video of all the best clips and parts would be a great addition to the full matches.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I'm game for a full video but I'm also okay with a 10min video. Anything is fine really.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,10 minute videos are better  if you have the time to watch a full match  watch a past broadcast on twitch.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Maybe what you could consider doing is posting a full video  for those of us who want it  and then put a comment with the times where you would have edited it to for those who want to skip past the 'uneventful' moments. Not perfect but is a compromise.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,The more hutch the better. Full vids  short vids  all good,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,If you can swing a mix of both I'd do that  seems like what the people want  cousin.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like the full videos. I only watch when I have time to kill and I want to get the full story when I have said time to kill. Give me all 20 minutes!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full length please,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,seeing the full footage would be mint but do what you feel is the right dude if that means shortening the vids then fairo,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like raw footage/gameplay upload it all!! We can always fast forward/rewind,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full gameplay would be awesome! We love the banter!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think for squads/duos you should post the entire match  because of the coms and stuff. That being said for solos the cut down version works better,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I prefer full-length gameplays.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Post the whole video  because you already make highlights videos of your games. I also enjoy watching full games  no matter their length.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like this shorter length video but I would also like a longer video with a longer voiceover intro during the slower parts,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like to see the Full video Take the stress off the day,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like these short videos but I wouldnt mind the odd long one (20 min) once a week.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I'd prefer the full video  as I cant watch them streams with my odd hour job  and I'd love to listen to more of your commentary,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,naaa keep it as 10 minutes otherwise the video is too long. if there is any funny banter keep it in but otherwise I have little desire to watch a 25 minute video of people running around,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I'm a huge fan of the stream highlights honestly. They're hilarious and contain some high quality laughs and game play,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I enjoy seeing the whole gameplay mostly because it helps me learn what to focus on early game to set myself up for success. Plus it means more time listening to you and your friends chit chat  goof off  etc.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,i had a game end in tilted towers. there was 8 people left in the last circle before it closes all the way in,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full gameplay definetely  just put a timestamp where you would have cut it  saves you work and makes everybody happy.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full length video,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,ANSWER TO HUTCH'S QUESTION:  I'd prefer the whole gameplay  but either way could you PLEASE set up a playlist for your Fortnite videos (and update it moving forward)?,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like the full game play personally,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,lol diesel is being such a dork,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full vids please.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Nice video  not gunna lie cant watch your live streams anymore the political banter is just too over whelming most of the time. Still appreciate the content though dude.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,It really depends on how exciting a full gameplay video is  Hutch. If you have commentary that fills the void of 4 or 5 minute runs  then post a full video. Otherwise if the void is a void then editing may be the way to go. I will watch you whether you post a 7 minutes video  or a 1 and a half hour marathon. If you  yourself are being you  then I will be here every time. And if I'm being honest  you do what you are comfortable doing  you beautiful son of a bitch.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Has he said why he's stopped playing cod? I don't mind fortnite but it'd be nice to have a mix.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full vid please.  Also  please unban from twitch chat.  Was banned for GoT spoilers that weren't actually spoilers earlier this year when I referenced things from season 5 and 6.  Thx,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I would like full gameplays  and also the highlights are great. So if you just upload a video such as this as the full gameplay 10/10 would watch.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I wouldn't mind the full games. I really like this game and want to get better.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I enjoy the cut down videos. Anyone who wants to watch the whole match can just watch it on twitch. Maybe link the VOD in the description for those interested.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I don't mind the full video so long as they're not 40 minute matches. But 15-20-25 is fine. :),Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I rather the more action,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Yeah. Post the full games man and keep those jeans high and tight,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,full length videos! Also I'm a huge fan of the fact that you don't spoil whether you win the game. Keeps the anticipation tight. I wish other youtubers would do the same,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,full gameplays we want more hutch!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I would like to see some videos with full gameplay and some without.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,i think its great that they offer very different environments  to allow for preferences in landing etc. each city shouldnt feel the same also i personally prefer shorter videos but i dont mind skipping the longer ones so everybody gets their favorite.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,10 mins is good,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,i honestly started watching again because it wasn't the whole game. shit gets boring,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,shave it down to 10 minutes,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like both full gameplay and highlights  so either is fine by meeee.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Mixture of trimmed and full length. Definitely want to see what you guys go from start to finish.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full videos. Also try to upload with better quality.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Can agree tilted towers is full of bullshit. Good place to be a little shit with traps tho,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,The longer the better! ;),Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think both would be cool  I like to watch more action but since you got me interested in this game I started playing it and I would like to just watch the whole process of a game so I can learn something :p,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,That is notepad worth! :D,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think both but I would love some full lenght,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,My only suggestion is trying to keep uploads from streams that happened relatively recently. I know that might mean a little more work but it's sort of odd watching/playing the new updated map and then coming on here and you're still in the old map. It's not a big issue but it gives the impression of being behind the curve. And again that in of itself doesn't mean anything  just an observation.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I just want something other than fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Definitely prefer the edited down but might like a longer every now and then  but I prefer ~10 min videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Can someone explain rotation to me? I always just say hey guys let's go to retail row. Or whatever. Are you saying there's an actual system with right and wrong places to go?,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full videos are what I enjoy the most  get to see how it all plays out for you,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,That was amazeballs,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I prefer the 10 mins videos with highlights  be it gunfights or some funny moments with your friends. Easier to watch really. If you want to make more instructive videos on how you play thats ok too. Do what you feel like man :),Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like watching entire unedited videos  but if there are periods of downtime  maybe include a timestamp or two in the description to points in the video after bits of downtime  specifically for those people who prefer the shorter version.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I prefer the 10min videos personally,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Every fortnight (pun intended) upload a full length video Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,id love to see the full gameplay because of the reason you said.  Keep on pumping out great stuff!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,IDK if this helps much but I like both types of videos and prefer when you switch it back and forth from highlights to full gameplay! Thanks for the videos hutch  youre awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Yes longer please daddy.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Even though I watched this on stream  watching here because I support you that much bro.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,lets see full,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Hecz and J sound really different in this video,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,The full length gameplay you did with Sark is the best entertainment of this game I've seen. More of that please.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think both types of gameplay would be great. I'd like to see longer ones to see your squads strategies  but shorter ones tend to be more entertaining and action packed.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Yep  post full game!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,full gameplays!!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think both have there benefits  10min edits show the hype and most action packed moments while full game can show flow  map movement and more decisions being made that can help viewers improve. Do you think you could do some commentary in one of your upcoming videos on what types of decisions you make at the start of a game? I usually have no idea what kinda moves to make based on where the bus enters each game  when or where to drop and how to make the most out of the first few mins of each game,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I would rather you only be uploading your very good games and can decide whether to show the full length or not based on how entertaining it is. A little bit after you started uploading games on here you were only uploading crazy gameplay where you shit on people and now I feel like the quality has trailed off quite a bit and you upload any wins..,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full gameplays!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Diesel is a piece of shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Same i dont really like tilted towers... doesnt fell like the kind of gameplay that fits fortnite style :) But the rest of the update is awsome,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I like the videos the way they are for the most part  but I'd watch some full length vids too.,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Nooo why are we down to 926k subs? The 927 curse must live on!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,I think the full gameplays are so much fun to watch for precisely the reasons you outlined. Watching how you guys decide where to go and what do to makes it fun. Especially when you play with such funny people,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,full games!,Hutch,shaun0728
Fd3tAmwNvgc,Full length matches fa sho,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,what is with these 2 minute long unskipable ads- this is bullplop,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,If people think the double pump takes skill to use and isn't overpowered  you're either 12 years old or younger or partially retarded,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,DP?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Thought you were going to stop double pumping?!?!?!?!?!?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,You must be a nightmare to play with. No communication at all still love the video  but seriously poor hecz.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Hutch  do not keep your beer on the floor. Even if its a disgusting ipa.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Throwing it out there... But I'd love to watch Hutch play Sea of Thieves with Sark and Seananners  perfect game for their chemistry,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Its good to see you and hector getting along so well  great video!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,You have YouTube's too long to not a have a million,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,that double pump is fuckin' dirty,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Whos the chick? She sounds hot,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,EMBRACE THE PUMP!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,even when the damn drop is in his way he refuses to open it  why? ( 2:20 ),Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,it's your fault Club Penguin no longer exists  fuck you Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,0:06 nice pun,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Lol @ Hector saying Hutch's shots were too loud to hear anything else when Hutch wasn't even shooting,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,I always have room in my inventory for rockets and/or grenade launchers for any game type.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Double pump faggggiiit,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,hutch i swear you were at 970k subs like a week ago and now youre at 926k? did youtube remove a bunch of subs again or something?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,GET THE NOTEPAD!!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,9:28 "Nothin personnel  kid",Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,I play on console which plays slower by nature (usually) and in my case I like to build up and fortify in the end game in which case rockets are incredible. Having height and being just a little careful not to nuke yourself could guarantee you the win in almost any situation. In my experience,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,That 4:20 duo kill is one of the best things ive ever seen Hutch do,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,9:29 what kind of weird fucking stairs are those?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Open bottle by the warm computer? Cat's gonna kick that shit down :D,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,That shot was spicy!! I actually said wow out loud,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Does ur back hurt? H3cz doesn't look small and with all the carrying you should make sure you're icing your back and stretching.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,1638 paying subs yesterday. If the lowest donated was $1  that would mean hutch could make $597 870 before taxes if he played and averaged that every day before taxes!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,sounds like hutch just sucks with the rockets... doesnt seem to be holding him back too much tho,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,6:29 lol,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,fuckin great video Hutch!!! deserve all the support Sir!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Shocked hecz hear hutch shooting when he called out numbers and hutch wasn't even shooting....,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,I gotta say I think the opposite about rockets. I find them much better suited for solo games  if you're a decent builder you can easily avoid killing yourself and the rockets work well for def. and off. strikes. Grenade launchers are way better for squads because you can shoot so many at once to destroy bases and blitzkrieg people pretty hard,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,I just recently bought a pc  coming over from console  and was wondering how you guys keybind everything...the only thing I'm having trouble with is figuring out what my building should be and how to switch weapons. I'm using a couple of buttons on my mouse to build walls  floors and stairs. And 1  2 and 3 for switching weapons. Do you guys use the scroll wheel to switch weapons or do you take your middle finger of W to switch?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,How are they able to come in and start talking to each other? Is that discord?,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Hutch is like OG. Not like this money hoes clothes shit. Straight OG like biggie n pac,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Nice launch pad kill.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,U n hector make great teammates! Fun watching u guys play,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,love seeing how much better at building you have gotten!  So fast and smooth now,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,QUESTION TIME Hey Hutchy  have you guys tried the riding a missile from a launcher thing? Seen it arround  aboslutely an abuse  but so stupid it's funny!,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Please don't tell me What to Fucking do with my feet,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,This game is very H3CXTIC,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Should have been titled "Do you have headphones?" Love the videos as always,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,It feels like Hector is more relaxed in FNBR  so it's a lot more pleasant to watch/listen. Nice double pump. I certainly can't swing it with the transitions under pressure.,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,The golden rocket launcher is a must pickup imo Hutchy  does so much (splash)damage. It annoys me that u aint picking it up but thats fine! love the vids bro,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Watching this live was intense,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,Hutch are you still balding? seems like you found a solution lol missing the skinhead,Hutch,shaun0728
X8vp1pol_Gw,First,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,No more "Bitch Myth" peaks,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Liking the fortnite!,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Love the friends title,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Wait how is someone asking if you could play another game toxic?,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Still getting NRA ads  Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,hutch i love your stuff! havent owned a system in about 5 years now  but i dont need one because I watch your videos everyday! keep it up,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Lol he took your rockets then manages to blow himself up with them then you immediately take them back. I lol'd,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I think about playing Fortnite on a computer then I see Hutch's videos and decide against it.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,What vape does Hutch use?,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I dig you  hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Jesus he says the same thing in all his intros.......we get it hutch  you like fortnite and that's all you want to play regardless of what your fans want.....,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Hutch try and play with Itemp both of you are boss at this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Jericho is a good dude but wow does he fucking suck,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,love the vids bro,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Headbangin thru ur intro bro,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,great vid as always hutch  prefer your cod and fortnite videos over any other youtuber. I occasionally get to watch your twitch. I woke up in the morning the other day and watched the stream where you got a bit drunk haha. gg,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZtIU2mrPeQ&t=919s Start at 15 minutes Hutch someone doesn't like the beard  AT ALL.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Jericho blowing himself up was great. When he gave his explanation and hutch cut him off and said "you've got to better than that  bud" I started rolling. Great vid,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,play whatever mab =its just fun watchingf you play. sorry that makers makr tALKIN i cantr be fucked with the spelliny,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,i agree i hate the taste of vodka,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,luv your vids and watching them makes me better at this game so thank you :D,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I have a request hutch. When you skip boring parts of gameplay  have it play but at like 10x speed or something. That way the continuity isn't lost and we get back to the action quickly,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Good choice playing with Jericho... he's like a younger you. Like he's your brother or something.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Tilted towers is ruining the game,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I prefer to have the option of watching Hutch play a game he's loving  and occasionally skip a video if I'm not feeling like watching Fortnite.   Because anyone who's been here for a while knows that a possible alternative is Hutch burning out and vanishing for half a year.,Hutch,shaun0728

ZiCZerDtf_4,The hype around fortnite got me playing it recently. Watching these vids def helps me play better. Tryna hit #1 soon!,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Yo hutch love having you back putting up exciting videos. one suggestion i have for you/your content regarding fortnite would be to move the POV camera to the left side of the screen. I think this would be better because there is more room on the right side on the screen because of the 3rd person camera angle. cheers hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,what flavor you vaping?,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I've been silently enjoying every moment of your Fortnite content please keep it up!,Hutch,shaun0728

ZiCZerDtf_4,I wanna see the dull parts too! Youre a beast. Damn,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,This video is clearly showing why an AR is better than a hunting rifle at mid range. Hunting rifles trash,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I am absolutely terrible at this game  but damn it do I love these videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Has he done the team's of 20s match up or plans to?,Hutch,shaun0728

ZiCZerDtf_4,Love you Hutch. Keep doing what you do man.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,Hutch  you do what you do bro  you sexy beast!,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,I do want to say that I am loving these videos - you're one of the few people I've been watching Fortnite from consistently. Because I don't have the money or time to invest in a gaming rig or sitting down to play games like this  it's very entertaining to watch your gameplay. The one thing that I've been craving  though  is not a new game  but rather a slightly different approach to the uploads you've been putting up. When I watch your videos  I've noted that the vast majority are stream highlights (which are fantastic  by the way) or edits with a quick intro. Again  I am enjoying these immensely  so I don't want them to stop  but I do think it would be awesome to get a full commentary out of you every once in a while. I think the game also has a single-player component  so maybe you could show us that gameplay while you talk. Even if you just did a voice-over of a session like this  I think that would be highly entertaining. I'm open to pretty much everything. What I will say is that  because everything seems to be stream edits or highlights  it feels like your YouTube channel is almost a second thought and has taken a backseat to the streaming component (which I totally understand - it's beyond unhealthy to try to work two full-time jobs). Even if it's once a week with a commentary over a session that would otherwise have just done a quick intro (like this video)  I would love to have something that is specifically for your YouTube channel  as my schedule has made it impossible for me to catch your streams.  I know  I'm a nobody and probably in the minority  but I thought I would give my two cents. Love ya  Hutch  and I'll certainly keep watching  regardless of the direction you take. Cheers  mate.,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,hutchFreedom,Hutch,shaun0728
ZiCZerDtf_4,serious question  what s the name of the very first song ?,Hutch,shaun0728

sS_gwZvv9LU,I loved this video Hutch! Love the editing for sure! Laughed out loud multiple times!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,"You're not allowed within 2000 feet of a school  I am not allowed within 2000 feet of a school"   Has to be my fav Hutch line of all time,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Hutch listen to me. This is important. Use the pump action  I know I know that slow rate of fire . But  I am watching you. you lose more not because you are not hitting with the semi. Your getting them buddy. Its the range man. That pump will annihilate at that range the semi can't handle it.  Help me pump b wan kenobi. You are my only hope.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,ok,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Enjoyed the highlights. Editing is a little rough  though. Seems basic and gimmicky  and there's a ton of typos.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,The song at 3:20 sounds like David Lynch Dark Night of the Soul,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I like it!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Editing is pretty bad. It's like every other highlight video that makes me feel like a little kid because I'm watching flashing misspelled words. If they're actually "highlights" they should stand out fine on their own.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,@Hutch 2:27 You're**,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Want to thank you for introducing me to this game. Honestly  watching you at first  I didn't get it.  Downloaded to my PS4 the other day  really gave it some time today  and I get it now. Having fun with it. I am terrible at it  but it's so addicting. Now if I could just stop dying to the storm...,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Love this,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,hutch the new format is really nice! I like a mix of the full gameplays and these types of videos  so it works really well!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Hey Hutch its me again. Still wondering if you could legally become my uncle,Hutch,shaun0728

sS_gwZvv9LU,Love it  need more!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,that was a funny video  loved the editing!:),Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Your editor is killing it. She's got talent.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,i love that is was able to see some of these live  glad to see some good editing maybe next time cut it into two vids,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Do I detect Teo-inspired editing? I like:),Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I love this game but find dying mildly irritating in how inconsistent it feels. I can have full health and half a shield and get two shotted by somebody with the shgotgun while I've been putting round after round into them. I watch Hutch one shot somebody with the sniper and for some reason I've not had that happen. Even last night I hit somebody three times and they still survive. Just to be clear it's the inconsistency I have a problem with. And the bloom sometimes is straight BS  I get what Hutch is talking about in the  previous vid and I agree  but I've gone back and looked and seen my reticle right over them at mid range and I'm tapping away and there's no hit points for ages. It sort of takes the shine off the game.    I also wish there was a better way of dealing with the first phase in BR games. If I get a grey pistol or a grey SMG (along with the usual ammo  wood  grenades bandages etc) after looting a couple of houses I know it's only a matter of time I'm dead from a shotgun or a half decent AR. That RNG I can go a couple of games and any early encounter means I'm basically fucked. And I've played quite a bit and I don't know if it's my bad luck but I only ever get a FAL by looting somebody I kill. I honestly don't remember picking it up from a chest. Am I missing something  do they only drop later in the game?,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Noah is like god tier at this game,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,New set up/background hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I love the new editing,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,1:05 How I feel every time I try and play fortnite.,Hutch,shaun0728

sS_gwZvv9LU,These are amazing!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I wish i was half as good as Hutch at this game. I get owned every time i log on.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Hutch!!! More of these! Love  Mozos :),Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,why are you reusing these same videos?,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Fokking moron,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Typos man and excessive font usage.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,i really hope you're still actively searching for an editor because the one you got is a one trick pony and it's already getting really  old,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,This one is directed by Tommy Wiseau,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Nice editing!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Haha these are fucking great,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I find these easier and more entertaining to watch than the full game-plays. Keep it up!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,that shot at 5:50 good heavens,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,hutch is my dad,Hutch,shaun0728

sS_gwZvv9LU,Amazing highlight real @Hutch #Hilarious,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,i like when hutch talks about how hard he is i imagine his shriveled knob attemtping to rise when called upon.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,That second clip man. I must have watched that 12 times and now my stomach and cheeks hurt.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,My favourite highlight video so far. A real pick and mix of moments and that "Get Fucked" kill @8:54 was amazing.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I hate dying in this game and 3:35 LOL,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,The squad is lit fam those are some wifey goals and my nae nae is on fleek so hit the Quan on my dab good sir,Hutch,shaun0728

sS_gwZvv9LU,Get this man to 1M subs already!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,When one of my OG favorite YouTubers (Hutch) ends up playing with one of my favorite twitch streamers (Goth). What a legendary day,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,"Diesel starting a car" killed me,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Amazing editing  Karyssa. This was so funny,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,100% love this new edit  the zoom ins are exactly what my brain does anyway and the subtitles add to the moments,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,The shot of my life was a 1400m sniper headshot on bf4 silk roads (desert map). Great video btw hutch!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,This was great  nice to see some low lights mixed in!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,These edited videos are great  more please,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,meh,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,This was amazing in every way,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Enjoying the editing  but my brain hurts more and more every typo I see. Other than that  great videos!,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I still let my mom wipe my ass. Anyone else?,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,5 star vid.  But Karyssa's youtube link in the description still brings us to a non existing channel!  And this video doesn't feature Hector or J again! :P,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Karyssa straight up killin the game. A nice balance of this and full gameplays with a classic Hutch intro  and you might find yourself at 930k. /s,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,I like the editing of this one. Another one please.,Hutch,shaun0728
sS_gwZvv9LU,Love how these are put together  keep em' coming!!,Hutch,shaun0728

0imtixS4P4Y,How can anyone say they like the maps in this game...?,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I run on a moderate xbox one setting and constantly get lag and hit markers. Frustrating as hell.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Love for the fleetwood mac attack!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Sorry  but an ace is 5 kills not 3.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,So so true man  I'm in southern Ontario and I'm literally always on a 2 bar it's infuriating. I'll get first shot on kids then my 2nd and 3rd shot go right threw them. I've always had issues with the servers but never like this,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,mate never heard of you  you cant be that awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,i cant even get into the game haha (xbox)--consider yourself lucky!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Great video. Lost it when you threw the controller. The final song was a nice touch.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Does hutch have PS4 or Xbox?,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Have you port forwarded bro...,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Love ya bud,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,1. Democrats fought FOR slavery. 2. Democrats founded the KKK. 3. Democrats fought AGAINST civil rights. 4. Democrats STILL exploit minorities for fun and profit.  This is the political party Hutch supports everyone.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Lmao this dedicated servers conversation reminds me of game dunzo back in the day. Anyone remembers that?,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Oregon here. Playing on pc  it seems like 40% of the time im getting two bars. Its a toss up whether im going to have a decent connection or not.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Hutch dude! This is the worst cod since modern warfare 2 with connection issues! Even when I've got a 3 bar I could be just fucking raining hell on someone with full auto fire and my hits don't register til about 3/5 of a second after I actually shoot,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,That intro was some WingsofRedemption type shit. I would've tried to make it sound a bit more sarcastic even though it is true,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Uff Da!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Online gaming is dead to me because of DLC  incomplete half assed games  terrible connections. Micro transactions. I bought a ds with Legend of Zelda installed. Never been happier.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Actual boss,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,#demonitized #copyrightinfringement,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The funny thing is that you believe they put in dedicated servers at all. When you see two different things happen  one is what happened before your eyes and two is the alternate version of what happened on the replay  that's one of many signs that you're dealing with p2p.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I'll try it again   These bars are meaningless  we need an actual numeric value of ping  latency  jitter  packet loss  etc anything is far more valuble then these useless bars as a tool for representing lag.  As far as servers go  if you take some time to even somewhat learn(they are very technical) network monitoring programs like wireshark or packet tracer  which displays all incoming/outgoing network traffic and can do much more. You can see where your packets are being sent ie a dedicated or listen server or a client/pier host otherwise p2p.  Dedicated servers from my experience and research can have specific sometime wierd names unlike client hosts that have a numeric external or public IP address. At least on console.  Of the 400ish matches I've played  wether it  be public  ranked or gb in this game  I've only been connected to a dedicated server a handful of 20 or so times. That is absolutely ridiculous. This same thing happened with shg last title AW  not to mention their poor networking and matchmaking system.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Even the pub servers are ruined Hutch... if I get into a game I can tell if I'm gonna hitmarker all game or melt. Hitmarkers I just leave now and find another game.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Fucking loved that intro xD,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Hutch you are incredibly popular and have the wisdom and modesty of a 84 year old modest old person,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Fuck I love Fleetwood Mac,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Ok I was actually in the stream for this one because I distinctively remember hecz saying the watch your profanity meme at 4:27 lmaoooo,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Australia gets fucked over as well.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,TWO ACES! hahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Just watched immarksmen run oldmanoptic over,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,east coast is 3 bars all the way,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,If there are any new viewers that clicked on this video for the first time in your channel  you would have made a bad impression on them from that intro lol .,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Yeah  I don't understand why the West Coast Servers are trash bro  whether in pubs or not.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I stopped playing I.live in nd Canada and can barely hold a 2 bar so it virtually impossible to play but I already bought it so why the fuck would they care :),Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Vaping isn't cool anymore!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Not really a fan of the mid screen face cam.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Guns are so balanced that the only non-automatic guys you see are snipers. So balanced.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I have a four bar but once anyone is in the game with a red or orange bar my connection is messed up. I am half a second behind in ranked. If everyone is four bar green then it's ok but out of 30 ranked games I have only had 2 that did not have sombody with a shit connection.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,What game are you playing  because 8/9 maps are atrocious,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Hutch the problem you're describing has plagued gamers in the middle east and africa for years! I remember always using sub machine guns for the same reason  you knew that one of those god damn bullets would hit  I feel your pain,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,How about the terrible hit detection in this game,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I will sell my soul for this shirt.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Bait title 3v3,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,If you fire the Bren on pc the first shot dose not register,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Everyone knows Hutch is the greatest video gamer of the 90s  2000s and 2010s. No doubt in my mind,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Wait  is this one of those guys who makes videos and puts them on the internet?,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,That ghost bullet was questionable. It wasn't shoulder  it was more like elbow. It was a poor example to use when complaining about servers.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Not having a single issue with GB-servers. But then agian  I'm from EU and we great internet *HIGH-FIVE*!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The first part where you're bigging youself up made you sound like such a douche,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I think the connections in this game are just bad in general.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,It happens in pubs as well. Even when all players have 3 bar. Also getting shot when you know for damn sure you were around the corner,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,That transition was nasty,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Heh  well i ave a bad internet  and even on public matches  I run a 1-bar connection no matter what I do. I's really frustrating...,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Best intro ever.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Are they going to attempt to fix the server issue or we stuck with this issue for the duration of this game?,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,This game is a fucking disaster! I've been playing online since 2000/2001 and in all that time  I've never seen such bad net-code. This game HORRENDOUS to play. This moron will never come out and say that a COD is shit. He will always look for a positive and sort of skirt around any issues with it.   And blaming the inconsistent and horrible gun fights on skill bad matchmaking is a prime example. It has got nothing to do with skill based matchmaking. It's the broken mechanics and net-code.  It is like  something has been put in it so that bad players can do well.   This game is fucking vile!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Thumbs up for the Fleetwood Mac.  "Rumours" is one immaculate album.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The intro cracked me up,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,the ending reminds me of your old edits with really girly songs.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Huffda Hutch  huffda...,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I live in central Oregon and I don't even know what a 3 bar is lol.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Havent played gamebattles but I play on north america and it runs smooth most of the time,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,You should use airborne inconspicuous. Move around fast and once you stop running you're silent,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The shot that you thought hit was off. If you pause it the frame before the scope turns white because of the shot  you can see it's too far left,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,But surely what you're asking here is a solution to a problem that has no solution? Like i play CS from the UK  and you can see where your server is on that but say i play with my German friends we're guaranteed to have varying pings because that is just how servers work since with UK to Germany we're probably talking about similar distances for west to east coast US,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,That obligatory pleading at the beginning saying how you really like WW2 lol. Just to calm the fanboys. Just say it how it is hutchy. I love how it's already gone from your favorite COD since MW1 (or something) to "in ahhhhh recent memory". I'll give you a month before you say well it's not Ghosts so that's something.   The maps are shit. The fact there's only 9 of them is also shit. The fact some get rotated so heavily also makes it boring. I barely played IW mp but honestly if you also took into account SP content then IW is a better game.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,For some reason I do better when I have a bad connection,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,''used to be a popular youtuber'' - fixed it for you  hutchybae,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Should just get rid of the bar indicator and have a ping count like Battlefield,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,i have a great connection But im always on 2 bars more often than not  i got soo pissed off about it last night that i accidentally broke my turtlebeach headset lool,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I live in Oregon   i always have a 3 bar on GBs,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Outro to the vid was magical. Many applause.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Slowed the video down to .25 speed on that sniper shot. Such BS! Sorry Hutch  hope your connection improves!,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I dont think there are ded servers at all. Shouldnt be getting the "picking a new host" msg if there are right? Hit marker city then melted is what this game is right now. hope they work on it...,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,strange intro to be honest  I only know you because you're a sex icon it has nothing to do with your game play and I am pretty sure a lot of people will be on my side with this.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The outro made me chuckle,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,I get the shit connection on 3 bar sooooooo. GG for there being 1 server for the entirety of Australia/NZ :(,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,Video made me smile.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,they took a bar away to make the connections look better remember when it was 4 bars you could get? and you were sure to have someone with a 3 bar in the lobby? yep a 3 bar in this game could be a 2 bar in other cods sneaky sneaky devs.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,low time to kill makes these newer cods boring when it comes gun fights especially 1 v 1,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,This game is ass lol,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The guns are overall balanced but they are just boring to use for some reason. IDK what it is. Gun fighting in the Black Ops games is fun and satisfying but in WW2 it just leaves something to be desired. Not to mention the Scorestreaks are pretty underwhelming.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,H3CZ is in Texas... say that 3 times fast,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,The veil has been lifted. Games like cs:go  overwatch and six siege have shown how much of a joke it is to claim cod is competitive. Cod isn't even the king of casual play anymore. You'd have more fun looking for a casual time in gta v  which is where most of the casual cod players have fled to. Which is why cod is just dominated by sweaty tryhards who have brainwashed themselves into thinking playing a glorified game of hide and seek is competitive.,Hutch,shaun0728
0imtixS4P4Y,never ever comment  but just wanted to tell you that outro made me feel things,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,"SeLFiMpLied.... fuck does that mean?" *giggles* stop hitting yourself.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Good Shit Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Is there no mounted mgs in game battles ?,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I think he's turning a bad situation around in his favor.  Since he made the choice to confess  popularity will probably be even more for him that it already is. I can almost guarantee you that when he comes back you'll see articles by places like Kotaku or Polygon titled something like "Popular PUBG Streamer Returns After Affair Confession".  Don't get me wrong I like the guy  but in the current state of humanity and the internet  people will do anything to solidify their fame  whether be it real-life or digital.  btw love u hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Hutch you always have an insightful take on things.  Every since I started watching you prior to your time with Machinima.   Keep doing what you are doing.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Are you heavily drinking today Hutch? I know how much major victories for Trump upsets you.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Spot on about Doc's situation. He owes us nothing. We don't mean anything to him. The only thing he needs to focus on is making this right with his family. Social media feeling the need to render a verdict on someone's character is very tiring. Hope everything works out for the best.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Is anyone else having an issue of receiving their level rank supply drop rewards? Every 5 levels it shows I receive a rare supply drop reward but it never actually shows up in my inventory to drop. Im lvl 40 on presteige 2 so i missed out on 30 supply drops so far... any fix?,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I like your rants Hutch  they really get me thinking about real issues.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,hear  hear,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I was waiting for this vid!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I agree with you 100% about the Dr. Disrespect thing,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,your words in this video are awesome Hutch!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Finally  some sense in all the unnecessary hate.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,All streamers should understand to some extent they are  role models and are held to a different standard then the community they serve. Be it right or be it wrong it is a reality. I commend DrDisRespect to stand up and admit a mistake and being a positive role model of taking ownership and trying to fix his error. He has not hidden from his responsibility. Folks need to back off and give support  rather than crucify and pile on.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,While what Dr. Disrespect did do something despicable  what he did is forgivable. Even his wife can forgive him. People pretending like he roasted thousands of orphans over an open fire are being ridiculous. He did a reprehensible thing  but he isn't Hitler people. Calm down.  But with that being said  #DrDisrespectWomen.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Miss these rants; this one was the best part of my day. If you had a podcast or started vlogging again I would be so happy,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Can we have less of the single commentary at the start and more gameplay. Half the video was just you talking  feels like half the video is a podcast not a OMOO episode,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Games shit and points in Dom are fucked up.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I agree 100%... couldnt hav said it better myself. But if i hav to wait for u to have to take a stand again to watch more omoo... i swear to garsh hutch... slappin u right in the penis,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,If it really was Dr Disrespect who this is about  I have zero problem as a fan with what he did.  It's none of our fucking business what goes on in his personal life.  He isn't a vlogger whose personal life is a central theme of his content.  Hell  I don't think he's ever shown his wife's face in stream.  It's his personal life so the man should be able to handle it however he god damn wishes.   Was it shitty of him to do?  Yes.  But to think people expect an apology from him is ridiculous.  Grow the fuck up and stop being a child.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Well said  Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I wish they made maps like they used to in old CODs. All the new ones are so small so no tactics and basically just a big shitty clusterfuck to play on.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Im assuming what he did is on your list of things that are unforgivable?,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Hutch for YouTube president!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Play chess again,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,hey Hutch just a suggestion  maybe when you are doing your intro talk play some old clips in the background  we missed five rounds of you guys talking to each other during the match and even though i enjoy your talks it does kind of make me like the videos less when you talk over a lot of the match  still love u though Hutch keep being awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,No idea what's going on hah but over the course of watching you you've thought me a few life lessons hutchy which are pretty useful when stepping back to get a further analysis on a particular moment  to say someone you've never met but look up to would have no affect on your life is kinda here-say but I don't think it should be immediate if you don't know them,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,:P,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Fight me!!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,It's simple really  people claiming other people are assholes especially in masses  are usually oblivious to the fact they are the biggest assholes here.(I think we can all think of groups of people who are oblivious to certain facts in some way or another) furthermore you dont condemn anyone for something they did that doesnt affect you at all. you could even commend him for having the balls to tell it publicly instead of lying to his audience and perhaps his wife. People make mistakes and like you said hutch  we should help them instead of condeming them. lastly I personally think  he should just kinda take the heat and run with it  since allot of people are not capable of seeing that the persons twitch stream is a caricature of a certain type of hardcore gamer  will mistake it for the person just being an asshole for assholish reasons. I am in no way saying I condone his actions  but the reality is we dont know the situation other then that the person for some reason felt compelled to to publicly apoligize for his behaviour  i think that shows character  and is something that should be respected since allot of people carry heavy burdens with them to afraid of what would happen in they'd let them go.  Just a random dad  that learned to quickscope from hutch when I was like 15. Take care,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,At the start of playing WWII I loved it and agreed it was one of the best COD's in a while  however as time has gone on I have found myself enjoying it less and less. I think the small number of maps is poor  the spawning on games modes such as domination is shocking  the levelling system has no balance from 30 to 44 you don't seems to unlock any weapons of value  semi auto weapons just seem to suck now and with the matchmaking servers every game is a grind  you can't just jump on for an hour and have some fun anymore,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Wtf fuck guys. I thought he killed someone or rape!! He cheated!!! Fuck the internet is getting soft. Why is this even a thing. Yes it's not a good thing to do but it happen. 100% of people experience this in there  life. Dudes have dicks girls have Virginias waters wet.   Hutch why are you even touching this. This has happened to you on both ends. It was radio silent when this happened to you and should be the same for doc.  Some times I hate to be part of the left leaning community.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,lol right after Twitch streamer of the year. He doesn't owe anyone shit. IT's no one's business other than his missus. Sounds like he was forced into it.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,hutch im curious about what your opinion is about people who play copious amounts of video games that don't stream. i just turned 21 and have been watching you since before the machinima days  but recently ive started seeing my gaming habits as more unhealthy than i used to... im in decent shape just from being an active person  so i dont mean physically unhealthy. but i often will choose to stay in on weekends rather than go out with my friends to parties or what have you. i used to justify these decisions because i had plenty of other friends online to play with/talk to. but now most of my friends seem to have "outgrown" games  and im left feeling like im wasting my time whenever i play a game.   tldr; if you hadnt been able to turn your gaming habit into a revenue stream  do you think you would still play as much  if at all? it just seems like as i grow older there are more worthwhile things i could be entertaining myself with  but i just have the most fun playing games.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,SHOUT OUT DR DISRESPECT BUT I FUCKED DAT NIGGA BITCH,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Personally I don't care for any of Dr.dr's business  I don't watch his content and never knew about him until the scandel  that's his business   I have mine  and you(general) have yours. Carry on.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,A man does not cheat especially where children are involved. Fuck him...,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I love how Hutch didn't post the streamers name in the title just to those extra views.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I have the same feelings as you Hutch  I have a really short list of unforgivables. I think context is very important and there aren't a lot of things that are simply black and white in this world of ours. Life is a hell of ride and we all make mistakes along the way  which is why it always surprises me when people are so quick and easy to judge someone else's behaviour.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I'd love hutch to actually debate someone....  let's say Styxhexenhammer666?  He'd get cucked real fast.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,A lot of these fans don't understand that entertainers aren't your friends  no matter how much money you throw at them. Even more than that  these fans are kids  and you can't teach positivity and kindness to kids. They'll eat anyone that upsets their ignorant morals...imo,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Hutch  you hit the nail on the head. They don't owe them anything. This blanket level of entitlement is just growing (or I'm getting older and more curmudgeony). This hilariously one sided interaction seems to foster this fallacy that the creator is beholden to the consumer. I suppose it only gets worse when more than just time is handed over.  Then again  the mechanism of a generation of entitlement is the pitch-fork and the stone.  The character he's created over the past decade plus doesn't appeal to me but I feel for him now as the villagers have lit their torches over something  it seems  he has deep remorse for.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Hutch I agree with you on that he doesn't owe his fans an explanation or something of that nature but the fact that you think cheating is a "mistake" I totally disagree with. I don't understand how cheating could be a mistake like just don't have sex with someone else  it's that easy. I've watched the doc for a while now and I just can't fathom how you can so easily forgive someone who broke up a family by doing something that is so easily avoidable. Cheating is not a mistake  cheating is a conscious act. But thats just my opinion on it.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,check out this pickle rick emblem it looks sick!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKBpqaR_B24,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Fair or not  celebrities are treated like public figures  and YouTube and Twitch streamers are becoming celebrities. It comes with the territory.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,U? A gaming sex icon???!  Bahahahahahahahahahahahaha.   Ur about as sexy as Jabba The Hut.  Definitely as slimy.  Fucktard,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Think you hit the nail on the head...,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I just come for the games and banter ILY hutch but I don't give 2 shits about your personal life. If you want to share it with us that doesn't bother me but its not what I come for and I don't understand peoples obsession with "celebs" personal lives. And Ive been watching you since you were an awkward little nerd gamer.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I agree that ppl shouldn't butt in on others business and unless it's something horrific (cheating is not) than relax and get over it. Now that being said  the infatuation and idolizing qualities of humans is exactly what allows ppl to make a living streaming in the first place. Having not seen any video of the confession or anything  I do respect the shit outta him for doing it  although I don't think he had to. If his fans lashed out unsubbing or w/e than fuck them they're idiots.  I remember another large streamer talking about ppl on twitter calling him "bud" or "buddy" and he lashed out in a rant one night about "im not your friend... we're not friends  I don't know you" etc. etc.  This was actually a huge turn off for me. While I don't get obsessed with streamers or personalities and I know i'm not their friend... its a little fucked up when ppl support you and you lash out at things like that. Like either you want ppl to embrace you and you play along or you fucking don't ... you can't have it both ways sorry. At least Doc acknowledged his audience as something important in his life... even if he doesn't know them personally and that I do like... wether he had to or not.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Gaming sex icon LMAO,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,A ww2 vid? Finally!,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Not particularly religious myself  but I think the Christian adage of "Let he who is without cast the first stone" is very applicable is this situation. In agreement with you on this one  Hutch. And thanks for the great content. :),Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,nah fuck that  people should know right from wrong and deal with the consequences  my heart goes out to his wife and i hope they can move forward without letting this shit fuck things up for the sake of their family too.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Amen brother!  I read some of those tweets and it made my blood boil.  These people judged him like they were perfect.  I really think if people minded their own business the world would be a better place.  Thanks hutch and well said.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,The Doc definitely doesn't owe his fans or anyone except his family an apology  but if you think people shouldn't judge him because everyone makes mistakes  you're wrong. I'm a massive Doc fan  but you have to be a pretty massive piece of crap to cheat on someone  let alone when you have a kid with that person. I have compassion on him  I understand it was a mistake  but still  it was the wrong thing to do and he messed up big time.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I'm 100% with hutch on this one.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Hutch I really needed to hear this.  Thank you for your opinion on the topic.  Thank you so much.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,2:50 Honestly it is super puzzling to me why he came out and said it unless there is a hidden motive. I mean it's not like he is a big mainstream celeb who really can't keep shit like this from the press. If he had just talked about it with his wife nobody would've known.  The only reason i can come up with is maybe he is trying to put pressure on his wife by making it a public matter or something.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,the problem isn't dedicated servers as much as it is activision not paying for good servers because they know they are going to release a new one in a years time so they don't want to waste too much money on a game which is not played in a year.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,My more or less brother  my best friend in the whole world who knew everything about me. We hung out everyday for years and years revealed to me during an acid trip that he had a series of personal awakenings. The top of which was him questioning his sexuality  and also that he was having a sexual relationship with my then girlfriend of 2 years. He had his own other problems  an eating disorder  drug addiction  things of that nature. A whole host of mental issues.   I haven't talked to him since then. It's been about 2 years. Some days  I want to rekindle my brotherhood and put it aside. He worries me. I want to be friends like we were before any of it happened. But I just can't do it. And I kind of resent myself for it.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I think people should stay out of their personal life. We tune in to watch the character  not the actual person. I'll still support them when they come back no matter what that person did in their personal life  because at the end of the day that person is an entertainer  and I am entertained by that person,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,He fucked up it happens. Not trying to sugar coat cheating but we're humans  we have urges. Like hutch said he saw an opportunity and unfortunately he seized it.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,By in large  I agree with the "put your self in their shoes" mentality. But you say things that are contradicting. You say everyone has a different story; well maybe that story causes them to put this action on a list of unforgivable  as it may not be just one mistake but viewed as the mark of a persons behaviour(not saying it is here  but could be the gut reaction of someone). Second you say they shouldn't apologize to followera because they are "strangers" but they allow them to do this for work and interact with them everyday  so it feels very personal on the viewers side and apologizing may indicate  like i said  its a mistake not a personality trait that is unlikable.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Who is hutch talking about?,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,With the whole situation about this "person". In my opinion he either decided to do what he did for the fans or to show how much to his wife that he is willing to lose all the fame to keep them together. What he did was fucked up and he should definitely be held accountable. My thing is personally if i had a really good friend that cheated on his wife i would let him know that he fucked up but i wouldn't try to hang him by a rope. Or try to send a lynch mob his way. He knows what he did is going to be with him forever and it will hurt him in the long run. When he does come back to stream on twitch i will still watch and support but that by no means Im ok with what he did.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I agree that he doesn't owe anyone but people who were affected an apology  but to call it a mistake is complete bullshit. Signing the wrong line on a document is a mistake. You don't accidentally fuck someone. That is very intentional.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Totally agree. There's not really any reason for fans to get mad or demand an apology - nor would there be an expectation of a scandal. Cheating may suck for his relationship  but literally affects no one else and is no one else's business. Quite confused by the whole crying stream confession thing and the big response.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I think that it's completely valid to say that entertainers don't owe their audience anything. There's no contract between the two parties  and there's no promises. But I think that's a pretty reductive way to look at the relationship between the two. When you stream/make videos  you include a large aspect of your personality  it's a part of your product. Viewers feel like they get to know you  like they've built up a (one way) personal relationship. It's part of the appeal - we have our favourites  who we always try to watch  who we try to communicate with  who we feel like we know. Sure  if you want to quit tomorrow without any word of warning or apology  you have every right to do so  but if you're holding onto that right  it prevents us from so freely building a relationship with you. When you want people to come and hang out with you every night on streams  there's an implied obligation that you continue that routine. If you just drop out of that  people will be pissed off. I don't think that obligation goes as far as what DDR shared  but I think that if you look at this as a purely transactional/business relationship the you're missing a big part of what makes you successful.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I watch your videos just so I can hear your voice while I sniff my finger after shoving it in my but,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Is this CWL variant ? Or any maps ? Cause I thought cocktails were banned and gebalrter or whatever was out of the map rotation for competitive,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,If he was transparent about it because he was being blackmailed like some suggested  I think that it's horrible that he was put in that situation. But if he said it simply for being transparent so that his fans know who he is and what he did  I think that is very commendable. It's the biggest mistake he'll ever make and I wish him and his family the best. I hope they can figure things out.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,You keep using the word "Mistake"  a deliberate choice shouldn't be called a "Mistake"  this word is deliberately used to downplay what was done  to quote the Last Boy Scout 'you tripped  slipped on the floor and accidentally stuck your d*ck in my wife'. Before jumping on the cheater apologist bandwagon (which is by far the majority stance of randoms on the internet) perhaps consider the impact on the wife and young child of the decision. It's not up to you to forgive this person on their behalf.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I feel like these S&D maps play waaay too quickly  makes me miss the MW maps  which were bigger and relied on more strategy,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,If he just cheated that's fine but he has a child with her.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,the people i follow on youtube/twitch owe me fuck all. they don't even owe me content (even if i'm a paid sub/patreon supporter),Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I agree Hutch  they don't us an apology. They owe who they hurt an effort to fix the situation if possible. People make mistakes  and things can be fixed.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,this comment is definitely hypocritical but i think you should stay in your lane buddy. no one asked your opinion on his decision and it sort of feels like you're preaching to your audience because you got offended by the comments you've seen. stick your nose in shit its gonna smell. im not going to comment on what dr disrespect did because it doesn't concern me. thats his choice with his life.  im only commenting because you asked.,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Best gay battle keep up the good work,Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,Well said :),Hutch,shaun0728
F3W0bJZhZJE,I think fans get too invested in the personal lives of their favourite online personalities. I know a lot of youtubers and streamers like to share that stuff  but ultimately it's none of their fans' business. You watch them play video games  if they don't call their mum as often as they should they don't owe you an apology. DrDisRespect's marriage has nought to do with his twitch channel.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Ugh. Hutch subscribes to that white guilt crap? Well... i guess this isnt the video for me. White people are the more despised people on planet earth  but riiiiiight  "they" are the ones with all the racism. Me thinks not.  He throws around "institutional racism" and things like that. But tell me one law that has people specifically giving a benefit of white people over another. That social justice bullcrap is exactly that.... bullcrap.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Thank you  Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I like the thoughtful discussion while playing a pretty intense game haha good shit hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Highlight videos kinda suck tho,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Henry is such a child  no privilege my arse,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,All other shit aside  because I'm not going to get into this long argument on YouTube  but did some dude actually insinuate that White Privilege doesn't exist? Has he lived in America? That is so far off-base  that it is legitimately scary. What's even more frightening; I know I'm going to get a bunch of people commenting on this that share his beliefs.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,At first I wasn't down for the fortnite videos  but then you started hitting your groove with the game. After "I PROTECT MY FRIENDS MIKE!" I downloaded the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I cannot seem to find the part that the comment section keeps writing about in which hutch said "White people are the most racist". If it's the part where he went on said that he believes there is a hierarchy then he is simply pointing out that the white population  in the western hemisphere  has some privileges over minorities. Not to say that claim is necessarily true but he for sure did not say that whites are the most racist.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,This man is stupid if you think what he said in this video is bad look at what he tweeted about during the election...clearly a pure idiot,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Hutch feels guilty because he's white... and more than likely a huge antifa sympathizer,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,New Cod is boring af ...im only 1 prestige in and barely play it anymore...Cod4 and MW2 i prestige to max multiple times,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I think you should just stick to video gaming. All your other views are pretty much fucking retarded. Its actually pretty cringe worthy hearing you talk about things that arent centered around video games. Listening to your views on just about everything makes me question why I ever began to even watch your videos  you could not be a more opposite person if you tried  and just hearing how much of a white californian you are makes me sick. You've been brainwashed so bad your entire life that you literally cant stand being white. You sit there and bitch and moan about all these issues like any of them have ever affected your life in any way shape or form as a white person living in california. I mean you could not be any less affected by anything happening in the world today  but yet it always seems those are the types of people with the strongest opinions towards everything. I just keep remembering all those videos you made about trump and how you were crying because Hillary lost  I mean what the fuck is wrong with you? You wanted a corrupt person hiding pedophilia and god knows whatever else shes involved in to win that badly that you fucking cried. A grown fucking man crying because his corrupt politician lost. How does trump being president affect you in anyway. Please im all ears. How is your life affected by ANYTHING in todays society regarding race? Living as a white suburban Californian. Im just dying to hear your brainwashed brain try to defend your mental state.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,The reason why the majority of minorities automatically perceive white people as racist is because white people invented racism. They have enslaved every race and nationality that have come to the US. From african to asian  native American even the irish were enslaved because they werent considered white. And now migrants. And if anyone wants any prove wasnt a mob of white nationalist marching down with tikki torches not long ago. This SHIT is getting old lets unite not separate people we re all AMERICANS!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,For all the things i have been given  and not earned while growing up  I give credit to my parents  not my race,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Good vid man. I'm enjoying the Fortnite stuff. Pretty confused about what everyone's getting uppity in the comments about. Seems more people have a problem with even bringing the subject up rather than what Hutch even said?,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Hutch... get out of LA every once in a while. Your white guilt is radiating,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Have you tried pubg? Like once,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,NOW i'm sure you're just recycling gameplay,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Im Hispanic and the Hispanic people I hang out with aren't that racist. Obviously I think it is safe to say literally everyone is a little racist it is inevitable. If you cannot understand how that is you are intellectual enough to comment back to me. Not talking crap but just don't wanna waste my time seeing a comment saying they are 100% not racist.... generalizing people and things around is how the human brain simplifies the world. So I agree with what hutch said in this video. White people are not only nationality that can be racist. He did not say how white people or non-white people are more racist than their counterpart idk where people are getting that from. Ignorant people are more racist than educated people. Educate yourself try to help our future become educated so we don't have idiots arguing about stupid shit and we  as a species  can focus on feeding the entire world  lowering violence  making scientific discoveries   etc. I think everyonr can at least agree with that,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,BUILD A WALL GOD DAMNIT. In the game that is.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,White privilege is a myth. It is essentially a phantom that we can't see hear  see  or observe but we have to believe in it.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,White frigility.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,at 9:40  damn that bullet grazed you. Thought you were dead for sure.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,black people are inherently more racist than white people because they blame white people for all of their problems  even if they have never met the person  on the sole basis of the color of their skin.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,'When you are accustomed to privilege  equality feels like oppression.' - Shaun King  Being born into white privilege doesn't automatically make you bad or evil or racist (because you had no choice about being born into that privilege) however you DO have a responsibility to call bullshit on it and seek to reduce its negative effects on your fellow citizens.   For anyone in any doubt  yes white privilege is real.  http://www.theroot.com/yes-you-can-measure-white-privilege-1794303451  https://www.umcjustice.org/who-we-are/social-principles-and-resolutions/white-privilege-in-the-united-states-3376  https://www.cpt.org/files/Undoing%20Racism%20-%20Understanding%20White%20Privilege%20-%20Kendall.pdf  https://www.thenewprogressive.net/ultimate-white-privilege-statistics/  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/black-income-white-privilege.html  http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/10-5-racial-and-ethnic-inequality-in-the-united-states/  https://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/16/report-finds-significant-racial-ethnic-disparities/  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_inequality_in_the_United_States,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Ground war was always really fun but wasn't in the newest COD for some reason?,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I for one am very disappointed in the lack of COD videos from Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,White people are fags,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,HUUUGE thumbs up for Speed Of Light in the background,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,awww hutch  your opinion is such a white guy. Oh wait  is that microaggression!?,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Man everyone is racist to some degree,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,im so confused why is everyone talking about Hutch's views about sex  gender  and race. im so fuckin confused. Where the hell is he talking about these things in this video?,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Wow hutch I apologize for all of the idiots that post in your comments,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Got my second squad win after playing for a week. This is easily one of the best games out and I'm looking for more BR games in the very near future.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Holy shit I love Hutch as a person but fuck his whiny liberal views are so fucking annoying. As a hispanic  I can 100 percent say that us minorities are WAY more racists than whites.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I love Hutch but God damn I can't listen to him go on about how white people are the most racist  and all that shit. I'm a HUGE Hutch fan  have been since the old days  but good lord.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I love your vids man but not feeling the duplicate clips lately. Seems to happen more with your fortnite vids than the others.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Love it brother!,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,I'm hoping battle royal type games are gonna take over now insted of cod I still like it but can't play for very long now and fortnight I can play all Day long imagine if they brought out a new map,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Hutch is not well traveled  obviously.  As someone who has spent a ton of time in Asian countries  the racism against white is VAST.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,The only subjects i absolutely despise listening to Hutch discuss   gender and race issues. He has so much white guilt it's just sad  everything he says is so absurdly bias.   It will inevitably be bias because you are you  it's called an opinion  but there are degrees and variations to it. Just to preemptively retort that argument. Being a white male is coloring his opinions so much.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,i like that hutch talks about real world issues. most people are too scared to voice their opinion and just talk about video games.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Got my 12th solo win today. It's addictive for sure!,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,Its ok to be white,Hutch,shaun0728

qZtHHSgEbG0,Can you leave the race talk for another video cuz thats just like the stupidest thing to talk about online ....smh,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,keep up the fortnite  bud. i love your cod videos  but fortnite is just too amazing.,Hutch,shaun0728
qZtHHSgEbG0,3:59 Everyone's a little bit racist  Avenue Q did a pretty good job at convincing me of that,Hutch,shaun0728

mTUTaHthrzs,As it's your channel you're well within your rights to talk about absolutely anything whether political or not. I personally wouldn't mind a sprinkling of it here or there  like how you used to give a mini-spiel during the intro segments  because it gives us a peek behind the curtains on topics that you genuinely care about!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,i think a set up video would be cool to see. been a loooooooong time,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,My problem with the heavy shotgun: You can double pump it if you get two.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,holy fucking shit why haven't you hit 1 million subs yet,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Politics divide people while video games can be an experience to share with others.  Thanks Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I don't need a full commentary of you going over the game but extended intros letting us know what's going on with you are good. I don't have time to watch twitch so I miss all that,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I typically play PS4 only. Is ever PC engagement like this?? So agro,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Love the videos  love the streams.  If you did a separate political podcast a couple times a week (or however often you wanted) I would download the FUCK out of it.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,More TDM with Hecz n Deiz pls,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Maybe pick a topic per week that the fans vote up  then you could pick the top one that peeks your interest,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,damn hutch become monster in this game!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Loving the fortnite gameplay even though I don't play the game personally. Would like to see some vids from your pubg stream the other night. Hoping BO4 is decent so we can have some omoo content mix in with the fortnite. Keep up the good work mate,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,been here since the epic mw2 fail  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck myyyyyy liiiiiiiiiiiife  love you hutcherson  in a nohomo low key full homo kinda way. stay awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Hutch  your shit is great. just dont pull a diction and only focus on twitch streaming to the point that your youtube fanbase dies. i know you make more money off of twitch  but it would be shame to see this part of your income die,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I hate the hevey shotgun for the fact that you can double pump with it. Everyone I run into with it does it and it makes the game unplayable for me.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,IMO  the pump is the one that needs to go  if anything. Getting 1 shotted at close range is just too much  one unlucky moment and you're out for the whole game.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,The video quality is so good these days hutchy. Fortnite is easily the game youre best at and ive been watching your vids like 8 years dude. Still would love to see chess every now and then but understand if you just arent into the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Start a movie podcast or something like that I know Hecz is down,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,When does camp hutch come back,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,would you ever consider doing a separate political podcast? would love to hear your insight on todays issues.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Idk  I always feel like the purple tacs better  when I get purple heavy I get standard hits whereas the tac will do a solid 90+ every shot,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Not that I dont love the fortnite content  but are you still planning on doing comedy like videos with other people in the future. You were talking about it when you moved back to LA and i would just be interested if you still have that in mind.  btw I tried fortnite for the first time today after watching it on your channel for the past couple months and holy shit  playing that game is way more difficult then I had expected. Much respect for how good you are!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,id love a podcast hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,HUTCH I LOVE YOU,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I'll miss the long talks you had but I understand you have to adapt your content as time goes on (much like many musicians do).  With that said my favorite content of yours currently is Fortnite but in Squads (Especially with Diesel or Hecz).  When ya'll are joking on each other it comes across as funny as hell and just a good time between friends.  Ya'lls banter is the best!  Keep it up bro!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Loved your videos since mw2 keep them coming Hutch!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Ben Simmons casually joins the discord,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Gotta love that outro showing my dudes from Slander some love,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Such arrogance. The fact that they kept playing when you were in their lobby is beyond disgusting!,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Been watching you pretty much since you began on youtube  back around 2008-2009. Still with you now  and going nowhere. Keep it up  my man.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Im an 9g! Great c9ntent as always Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Love the Fortnite content.  I love it all the more when you're playing with others  as the banter further makes me think that I have more than one friend. ;),Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Do you plan on doing OMOO videos in the future? or even chess again?,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Hutch  never stop Hutching sir. You're the Hutchiest Hutch that ever Hutched.   That is all.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Hutch has cats?,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Yeah I used to enjoy the long Hutch rants :),Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,BEN SIMMONS,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,If you wanted to stream talking about politics I would watch that.,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I f*cking miss you man !,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Maybe not long commentaries but what about another quality time with hutch eh? Greetings from a long time fan :D,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,A cometary would be cool,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Don't worry about the meaningful intros Hutch if they happen they happen  that's kind of the thing about them tho they're connective and intriguing but most importantly NOT forced. Keep the work up,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Blue burst > purple scar,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I appreciate you keeping politicals out of the videos  been an fan for a long time man,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Legend says his beard is merely a demonic beaver that feeds on gameplay and chess,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,hate when you fucking scream like a bitch but like ur vids so price im willing to pay,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Just switch it up  do some cs:go videos,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Damn hutch. Running NRA ads on your channel?,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Is that Ben Simmons at the end? Also  does anyone know how Hutch and Ben know each other?,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Christ the last guy ate SO MANY shots,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,Love these vids hutchy,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,I really like the song at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,i would 110% be for them removing the tac shotgun. having only the pump shotgun and the heavy shotgun would be much better. I was also just thinking about the commentaries that you used to do over your CoD gameplays  but i think fortnite is more fun to hear the sound live as it goes,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,yo hutch if your interested topics are political discourses than who the fuck cares  i would love hearing bout your views even if i dont agree with them keep up the good work  i dont comment often but ur dope af,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,great game hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
mTUTaHthrzs,PLEASE MORE COOKING WITH HUTCH,Hutch,shaun0728

EFaTuLFLcbU,The GOAT of Fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,Great game Hutch but I gotta say this is the second time I've seen you pop a keg just for shields  now I don't play Fortnite and I realize you can't use a keg in a firefight like you can with mini pots but it seems like a waste to me when you can just pop 2 or 3 of the 8 mini pots you had and  save the keg for when you're low on shields and health.,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,I love your videos and see flaws in your game play that if corrected could make you greater.  1)When traveling inside buildings (when its safe) farm the furniture for building mats. 2) I never see you use traps. You could throw these into the mazes when in a fire fight or  In the building's you loot.  passive kills ftw. 3) you could ues the building mechanics better for quik in's and out's of your own structures.  Love your game play and streams keep it up man.,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,i like the best of both worlds situation you have going on  i can see the best clips on your highlights with great comedic timing on your edits  or watch the whole shibang. great shit man,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,Sheesh Hutch killing it in this gameplay!,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,does anyone else wish friendly fire was back in the game because its just so easy to kill people who are around your friend with a rpg or grenades. I also wish i could use the sniper like you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,This was fun to watch.,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,hutch being humble in the intro bc he knows he was straight savage during this game. XD,Hutch,shaun0728
EFaTuLFLcbU,tilted can suck my dick,Hutch,shaun0728

wd4FDy7igng,Maybe it was their first game of fortnite? Fuck man  you are all quick to call them "shit",Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,How are all these guys potatoes  Says the dead person,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I was here for this in the stream ! That was a fun night on the stream dude,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Actually seeing you not playing cod just confirms everyone's posts about you being a bought and paid for activision chump. If the game was "best in the series" like you said in the beta  or "best in years" like you said after release then you'd be playing it right? I for one respect your choice to play whatever you want though. WW2 is garbage and your fortnite videos are much more fun to watch.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,The girls are annoying af,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I'm 100% with you  Hutch. WW2 is fun and everything  but it's just another CoD. Meanwhile Fortnite is something new and original  it's just so much fun. I absolutely love your Fortnite vids/streams :),Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Hey Hutch! How's that Trump investigation going with all that fake news you were spewing??? LOL! How about that Dem and FBI collusion??? People are definitely going to jail but its your peeps going to the pen! LOL!!! You need to walk away from that left wing garbage you read. You are not getting the real facts  just propaganda.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Remember when you played chess?  I do.,Hutch,shaun0728

wd4FDy7igng,I used to love those HolyCrapItsHutch COD videos back in blops 1 where you would just dominate and put it to music with no facecam or commentary. I know those are hard to make now with all the copywrite strike issues and the skill based match making  but still... those were the days.,Hutch,shaun0728

wd4FDy7igng,No joke if I get to pick an apocalypse squad  Hutch is immediately designated sniper. I want him safe and shootin'. With aim like his there is no failure.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Hutch are you high again? You are becoming a god at this game,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Fortnite fucking rules,Hutch,shaun0728

wd4FDy7igng,My favorite intro was the "gaming sex icon" one :'),Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,More like  "1v4? Standard ClHutch".  Don't worry  I'll see myself out.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Fortnite is infinitely more exciting to watch and it seems like you have more fun doing it  so you do you! You got lots of support here either way!,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Shields!!,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,fuck ww2  I only watch your fortnite vids  they're the best content since when I used to watch you at the age of 15 and now i'm 22,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Hutch id watch you play just about anything. Play what you enjoy my man :D,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Release the memos  find the texts,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Such a clutch ending omg,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Fortnite is better than WW2,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Wow,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I love watching these videos. Always brings a smile to my face after a long hard day. Keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,:/ 1v4 clutch versus people playing with their feet. This gameplay was BORING.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Truthfully Hutch  I watch whatever you post because I watch it for you. The games are entertaining and all  but compared to you  they're just background noise. Loved your content since the CoD4 days and will continue to support as long as you continue to be you. Much love from Canada dude. Wishing you the best.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,tbh i didn't care much for your cod videos. they seemed a little repetitive with all respect. However  your fortnite videos seem a lot more fun and appealing. keep up the good work man,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,this game is so much fun,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Relax  kick your beer up and and enjoy your feet,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Fortnite> cod,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Ww2 is so boring. Can't stand it,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,What happened to the best cod in years,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,No more COD,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I miss OmoO MWR...it's like an ex that she/he dumped you  but you want it back...,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Didnt really like the regular COD vids  but I really loved your longer format Omoo vids (40 min GBs). Any chance we will see more long content like that?,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,The ending was great. Lol,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I haven't played CoD since I got into Fortnite. It's so addicting to play and really entertaining to watch good players.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,that first clip was like watching a full grown dude take a shit on a bunch of disabled kids,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Post black ops every so often. Ww2 is /:,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Anticlimactic af,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,OMOO playing CoD was always an argument waiting to happen. Playing fortnight seems to be a lot a better of an environment. I'm glad it's working out better for you too.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I don't care what you play as long as you discuss some good ol' politics in the intro.  ;),Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,i dropped in the stream almost exactly when this youtube vid stared  hutch defiantly was iv the zone for it until the end,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Hutch what about chess?  That seems like a very season game for you.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Dude COD is never like  a fun time  like  community wise? The primary discourse around COD  the only thing you ever actually HEAR is how much COD sucks. If you play the new one  people want to see you play the old one. if you play the old one  why dont you play the new one. Like  just bail on that scene. It's not worth it. toxic af,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Saw this the whole time I was thinking nonway,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,I prefer to watch fortnight over cod   all day long,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Mad I missed this live. Stop having good games after my bed time  Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Will never be 1st,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,The Fortnite videos bring me in every time. The CoD videos don't  and I've been watching you for a loooong time now. It's clear that you love this game with a passion and it's showing through your content and making it very entertaining to watch. I'm truly glad that playing a game you've come to love is helping you profit so well.,Hutch,shaun0728
wd4FDy7igng,Do you,Hutch,shaun0728

ylSxpRiqYwM,As someone who plays on pc  i have to say sniping seems really powerful  i am not the greatest player by any stretch but it always seems like someone in all of my lobbies is fucking crazy with snipers. I would like to think that this is because of the precision of m+k that makes sniping seem as good as it is to me on pc  but i could just be bad lol.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Aim assist on PC is called cheating xD,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Even after the adjustment in sniping   you can still see that it needs a bigger adjustment. There is no way in hell you should be a inch and half away from a target with cross hairs and still hit that target.... they need to close that gap to 1/4 -1/2 inch max. That would be acceptable and keep the fun factor.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,The Bren was in CoD 2  but what people often forget is that it was also in World at War(CoD 5)  only it was under a different name. It was called the Type 99.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping is overpowered and anyone who disagrees is fucking delusional. I should not be more afraid of a sniper rifle point blank than a shotgun  it takes zero skill to L2 R2 really quick get an instant kill without even trying. I wouldn't even bring up skill but that's what everyone who snipes like to boast about it  how it takes skill. How ANYONE thinks an instant 1 shot 1 kill canon can not be overpowered is insane. I suck at sniping and go on insane streaks with them in this game. They have almost zero flinch  no scratch that  they have zero flinch when they get shot zoomed in when it should be stupid high  make scoping in slower too.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,CoD has always been a fast paced game...unless your king campy in his corner  so sniping should imo atleast be quick alot like sniping in MW2. it suits the fast paced rushing and kill style of CoD  just my 2Cs.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,JUST GET RID OF IDLE SWAY.  NOBODY SWAYS that much when actually shooting.  It's stupid and nauseating.  Gears of War has better sniping because it doesn't look like you're aiming while drunk.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Hutch are you not going to acknowledge that Sledgehammer had to fix a bug with snipers where scoping in automatically aimed dead center? This is the main reason there's been so many complaints about snipers  and its only recently been fixed.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I love me some sniping especially with the Kar. Easy collaterals and in the game mode "War" It's a good ass time.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,the two time..,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,this is the hutch i crave,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,what was that about around 7:30,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I'm getting sick of ur thumbnails hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,sniping feels really easy in this game and ive run into people running games just quick scoping. maybe this is just coming from BF1 and overwatch,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Which class do u use for two primaries?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Prometheus was a Great Movie. Loved it one of my favs. Wish covenant was better I feel I could if write a better script for it very disappointing,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Guns take 4 bullets to kill minimum in this game (for fully autos). Is it just me that thinks it takes too long to kill in this game?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,That song at the end is a real foot tapper.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,can anybody tell my why COD youtubers don't put that much effort into their videos anymore? Does it have economic reasons? You can barely call them commentators anymore.. thy used to call themselves just that back in the days when they also thought of interesting topics to talk about. I am seriously curious. Why is that? I personally am not interested in livestreams.. why watch sb play while i can play myself? I am interested in understanding this development... maybe they even put more effort into smh else .. idk,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,"That's how bad he is  he did not see the guy in the train" lol with friends like that  Hutch  what more could you ask for?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,good gameplay :),Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Hutch= legend 27,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,my fav snipeing was bo2 ballistic,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I like the adjustment they made because I'm winning more sniper fights now,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping is piss easy and super annoying in this game. It needs a major nerf because this game is unplayable right now because of the quickscoping. A sniper should not beat my shotgun or smg at close range. I hope they nerf the fuck outta quickscoping and if they don't then I don't see myself playing this game very long.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Oh snap sup doc,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping in Cod WW2 is too easy and requires no skill at all. Definitely needs to get patched. I'm sick of getting quick scoped across the map,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,It takes no skill at all to snipe in this game. Shit is easy as hell! What are you talking about?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,That ending is proof that Hecz is the epitome of the toxicity,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,"Every gun in that game was hard to use" I'm assuming he meant WAW which means he didn't play much of it  SMGs in WAW were stupid easy to use  LMGs were a step above that  and then the semi/bolt rifles were the hardest to use (with the exception of the M1A1 carbine) and Hutch the  Type 99 was the best LMG in WAW IMO   you put bandolier  stopping power  and deep impact on it and you have a serious fuckin loadout.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,What division are you using here hutch!?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Im new to sniping and im actually enjoying it and find it rewarding and satisfying. What is the best sensitivity for a sniper ??  Any tips will greatly be appreciated.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Quickscoping is OP in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping on pc is still ridiculously easy  on maps with longer sidelines like Aachen and USS Texas its normal to play against teams full of snipers sitting back and holding angles for a full game of TDM or Dom. I guess the poor map design has something to do with it  making alot of long maps where its hard to flip spawns and flank around without running into people holding angles is usally not a great idea.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Your calm and metered commentary soothes me as I poop.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Lol wait. Did you just say sniping in WWII is HARDER than MWR?!,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I love sniping in this game. Never sniped before either,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I don't sub snipers.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I honestly hate the idea of quickscopes and what not. So I like the changes. I respect that part of the community likes it so I'm okay with it still being in the game but making it more difficult. I think it's just cause I'm kinda old fashioned when it comes to sniping I think it's kinda dumb when you can use a sniper as a short range weapon.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,They haven't got rid of aim assist,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,NO WAY GET MORE OF THIS TWO TIME 6"7 BEAST OF A GAMER ON YOUR STREAMS AND VIDEOS,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,'My sniper is basically M1A1 Carbine with 4x scope,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I like the sniper change because without aim assist  it takes more skill and it keeps everyone from running around and quick scoping like in MWR or MW2.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,they made sniping pointless because assault rifles like the STG have no recoil  there is no distance where a sniper is even worth it  SAD!,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,this game is almost offensive that its called a world war 2 game ahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,is this playable on pc,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Shit dude... the KAR on pc is stupid strong.... might need a nerf in all honesty sniping in this game is very strong on pc...,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I started sniping because of you back in WaW (then back to CoD 4). I love the new challenge. I cant just walk up in a Hardpoint with full confidence like I could in past CoDs. Frustrating  yes. Rewarding  YES!,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I always turned off aim assist because it alwayd made my aiming worse lol. The way it move my screen was conflict the way i wanted to move it,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,crying about aim assist - it should not be in the game at all...,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Immortal Technique messaged you? Awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I would like if none snipers had aim assist except when you hold breath. Why does enfield get aim assist and springfield and kar dont?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I haven't bought a CoD since MW3  haven't really enjoyed one since Black Ops 1  but this one genuinely intrigues me since it seems reminiscent of Black Ops 1 and I loved WAW  hopefully it doesn't disappoint,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Let me get an old ass style cod commentary man. Throw us back.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,on pc sniping is way too easy unfortunately,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,hutch the only person i like in that group he plays with,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Black ops 3 sniping had no aim assist whatsoever...sniping in this game is easy by comparison,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,i hate the sound that the hits make it bugs me so much,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I prefer Battlefield over CoD in general but BF's sniping has been far more rewarding and fun compared to CoD's.You actually have to try and get a 1 shot kill in BF because they usually just come from headshots whereas CoD its always been "Just hit the general area of the torse youre good",Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping was dead for me ever since MW2  Black Ops 2 was quite good for sniping also.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,If you went into Blade Runner 2049 expecting an action packed movie and say it was bad/ or you don't like it then YOU got the problem. Clearly you never watched the original.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,this is reminiscent of the videos you made in mw2! which is when I started watching you. love you and your videos man!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I think sniping is slightly easier now honestly of course ive never been a great trick shot guy or a quick scoper either,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Got diamond snipers already !,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,"proper" sniping may be more difficult but since launch I've noticed the most ridiculous quick scoping is back with a vengeance.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,The type 99 is the japanese lmg with vertical banana mag. The funny thing is that was arguably one of the best lmg designs around for a while  with the Madsen  and most american casualties in WWII can probably be attributed to ambushes with Type 99/96 LMGs,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Do you see any added benefit from me turning on notis? Financially speaking mostly. I watch all your videos and I don't see the point of turning them on but if it helps support you in any way I'll do it.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping is easy in this game,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety  I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't reply please send help.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I feel like sniping in this game is pretty good and it feels easy,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Not good,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Really weak CoD. I actually expected this to be good and was hyped for it but this is such a disappointment of a game. There aren't any good maps in this  there are only tolerable maps and horrible maps like this one. Gun balance is just awful  there are only 2 good assault rifles and 2 good smgs. The snipers are stupid easy to use and quickscoping is AIDS. Shotguns are complete ass. I don't understand how they could fuck up CoD this bad  Treyarch has to come through in 2018  only good developers left. REPLY,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,In my experience  the nerf is a pretty nice balance between overpowered and underpowered. I cam go on some crazy sprees but also get gunned down if I get careless. I think they did a sweet job with balancing sofar. Only minor changes needed imo,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I used to do a hell of a lot of sniping in cod till black ops 2 after that I ran into the same run and gun bs that they were fully pushing  but I would agree that now with codww2 the sniping takes a lot more skill and flashes back towards the sniping I started doing. I always removed aim assist or never had it enabled when I just started so the fact they finally toke it out for sniping makes it a lot more skill based compared to always having a computer run it for ya.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,This guy talking shit on Bladerunner pisses me off.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,sniping is fucking broken in this game  its bullshit,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,It's funny because he didn't see the guy I. The train at the end.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,My sensitivity is 4 for both but I feel like it's too low for sniping. Should I increase both to 6 or 7 when sniping?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I never thought i would honestly ever want to play a cod again after bo2  but this game just scratches a itch when i watch it and when i play it. Loving the videos hutch  as always. Keep it up.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Before the patch  I noticed that there was no sway for about a second when scoping in and it was centered every time. It was never like that in any other call of duty game so yes  I do think it was necessary. And no  I do not find it anymore difficult to snipe/quick scope. It honestly just seemed like a glitch.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Am I the only one who finds this game extremely frustrating so far?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I loved BO3 sniping with no aim assist  so I'm loving the sniping here too. Like you said  it's very rewarding almost every single shot you hit. IMO older code like MW2 were way too easy with fast ADS + aim assist. I think sniping is in a really good place right now,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,I really hope hutch hits 1m he deserves it so much <3,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Such a photoshop  obviously the skinny beer guy is not fighting in the war. Who is he fooling?,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Bladerunner was never marketed as "action." He went in with the wrong mindset.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Fuck this shitty game.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,Sniping is a lot easier now that people aren't flying all over the place at 20mph. I always snipe and the only problem I'm experiencing is trying to hit things with all the lag.,Hutch,shaun0728
ylSxpRiqYwM,that playercard is perfect. never change,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,PIPE IT UP,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,You should learn tfue's headpeek. its actually nuts,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,comment for support,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,your outro song is different to the one in the description js,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,4:50 that poor guy trying out the new instant-fort lol,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Must be nice being good at games.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Heavy shotgun is trash. Way prefer the others,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Hell or High water is a great flick. 10/10 do recommend.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I like the T-Shirt  but I'm voting Rock/Hanks 2020,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I didnt notice anything in thr new patch tbh lol,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I like the new edits for the dead space  when he's rambling on about something it's cool  but it's much more clean when there's less dead space.  He still leaves like the suspense building dead space  so it's a good balance.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,i feel like they are updating and adding new items too fast now... seems like theyre just doing it to do it at this point,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,You shoulda thrown the impulse in the portafort at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,4:46 wreckedd lol,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,that beard has GOT TO GO.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Anyone else find his thumbnails cringe?,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I'm gonna need to cop one of those Hutch 2020 shirts...,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,After the update for xbox  the game runs so smooth now. Even when you land in a high populated area like tilted you're not lagging off of roofs like you would before.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Great video Shaun  quality content! When will you post some WW2 videos again though? Best game ever hihi. For real though  i'm very curious to see which game is going to be the next big thing on your channel Hutchz,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Damn weapon swap delay!,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,lol that was a really good intro. i wont buy it  but  quality advertising,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I just wish they would fix old bugs rather than add new features  i constantly have games where i cant mute people and many times where i cant swap or select anything in my inventory. Its nice epic is consistent in adding things but they should be focusing on issues with the game rather than add new things,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,On Ur 8th kill  the kid actually used a lag switch. Speaking of the old halo days...,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Vote for Hutch 2020 - because  fuck it. What other reasons are needed.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,i agree this patch is good. the patch i hate is the 100% accuracy first shot and the damage drop off,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Update is great  Hell or High Water is tremendous and Hutch for 2020 is paramount .,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Little Conro to end the video hutch? Respect!,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I hate this update it brought back the double-pump which I was hoping this update would delete  and not just that but using two shotguns in general I f****** hate it,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Hutch  I used to enjoy hanging out with with you briefly  then I saw you were using the patch better than I so fight me on Xbox you pc beta child,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,This video is a good example of how bad the Heavy shotgun is.  Pump all day,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Hutch you praised the aggressive nature of Fortnite alot here  this why you stopped playing Pubg?,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,HE'S GOT HAIR! ON HIS FACE! HE SHOULD WIN! THE ELECTORAL RACE!,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,holy shit those last guys were trash...honestly I feel like the update is fine but what epic should really focus on is to somehow punish camping. end game is just so boring cause you meet 90% trash campers...,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,"Pretty nuts at the end"  more like really bad players coming in your scar sight haha,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,#Hutch2020DNF,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,What does damage drop off do exactly?,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,They definitely nerfed the heavy shotgun. Fer shuuure.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Fucking love your intro's lol because fuck it,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,The shotguns are fucking trash right now  idk what it is but people just eat their bullets,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Horrible update. Punishes fast pace gameplay and building. In the update they also changed peaking  so now if you want to shoot on a ramp or over something your entire body has to be visible regardless of where your gun and crosshairs are.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I'm not really a fan of the updates from the last couple of weeks. They added the heavy shotgun which we really didn't need because the shotgun meta is already bad enough as it is. They added a somewhat OP guided missile and vending machines  something we didn't need either. And now port a fort? Come on now  stop holding the hands of bad players.  Aside from that  they have implemented what was basically shooting test 1. These shooting mechanics are in my opinion even worse than the original mechanics. They didn't even let us try shooting test 2 which sounded like much better and more logical mechanics.  The new delay between switching weapons is definitely a good thing though! But that being said  there should not be a delay when you switch from building to a gun,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Hutch for prez would be dope. Legalize Texas,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,The only weapon that needs a delay is the dam rpg thats it,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,what were those last five guys doing haha. That was so weird,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Dont like the new update is slows the pace of the game and lowers the skill gap,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,No way  I feel like everything seems more sluggish. I really wish they would change weapon swaps back to the way they were.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,I'm happy that they actually want to fix the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Dissapointed with your opinion to be honest  for me its simply the fact that the new update has the capability of getting you killed. There should be absolutely no reason you cant swap between a pump and a deagle quickly without a delay  because at the end of the day your shot is going to have to be good to make that meta work. Whereas now if you badly need to swap and youre swapping to a weapon where theres a delay  theres a brief time period where youre opening yourself up to getting merked that used not be there before. Also for me things like the double deagle which provided me with great satisfaction are now gone and its just made the game a bit less fun to play :(,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Trump/Hutch  2020,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,Nice,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,There gonna be a Cream Team Friday today??,Hutch,shaun0728
mxM3UjAl4dE,'Because fuck it' is a message we can all get behind.,Hutch,shaun0728

XtBFKsN3nog,He had the high ground Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Seems odd you posted such an old gameplay with having such a desire to be great at the game you must have hours of new footage no?,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Side comment to get better many hours of solo once solo gets tooooo easy dous solo the move to squads you will become a menace to be reckoned with!,Hutch,shaun0728

XtBFKsN3nog,The 14 people watching this video with birthdays today got super excited.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Well  My birthday was New Years Eve  so ill just tell myself that you were personally wishing me a Happy Birthday. You Stay Classy  good sir.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Honestly you forced me to unsubscribe dude reposting old shit or used shit from streaming is just lame bro  I get you complained about not enough time but bro you fucking play video games for a living stop it,Hutch,shaun0728

XtBFKsN3nog,The GP is fuckin old bro,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Ive heard you say you'll adhere to something like every year since whenever you started.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,@Hutch Maybe work at your APM game? I was looking at your stream the other day when you ran into Ninja. you pointed out how he must be on drugs because of his hyperactive gameplay but i think he's just super comfortable with mouse and keyboard and plays games with high APM. Wouldn't be surprised if he plays LoL or starcraft 2 alot.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,if you wanna get better hutch you gotta mess with building better and using different bindings.( I know you build good but could be quicker! ),Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,The choke is real. None the less  phenomenal video hutch as always.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,How about some Quality Time with Hutch with some bigger fortnite players? (Grimmmz  Ninja  etc.),Hutch,shaun0728

XtBFKsN3nog,0:53 commentary lines up with facecam poggers,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Be careful with that list Hutch. Some of your "fans" won't appreciate it if you don't add their favorite movies to it. They may comment with things like "......Where's this movie?" Or "No that movie?" Because all opinions should match up with theirs.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,I love how addicted to this game you are  I really like watching you play it,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,YES Hutch! I love movie reviews! (from you),Hutch,shaun0728

XtBFKsN3nog,Happy Birthday LOL In theory at somepoint someone will watch this video on their birthday so. Happy Birthday to you.,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Always love watching you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Happy Birthday Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Lmao Happy Birthday Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
XtBFKsN3nog,Love the idea of having more movie stuff around here Hutch  that'll be awesome. Also  check out The Discovery on Netflix  it's criminally underrated.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,wtf you destroyed that guy at the end. looked bullshit to me. that was a mad game hutch. you've become a beast at fortnite!!!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Gotta love the scourge of the community of fortnite players who wait till people are done fighting to sneak in for a kill. FACE ME WITH HONOR!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,So I noticed some hinges at the beginning of the video regarding double pumps. I've never used double pump so I don't fully know the severity of it. But is it enabling so that you don't even have to pump to get to the next shot of one you already taken a shot?? Cuz if that's the case that is incredibly dirty. Not on you just it itself. Help me understand haha thanks hutch! Loving the videos and hope all is well!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Play with Ninja. Please. We gotta see this shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Unlucky,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Hutch  keep in mind when you have a lot of steel you might as well use it. It would have helped you more in the top 10 I think.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Of course the shotty has to be OP. We're talking about the devs for Gears of War 3 guys... Come on now smarten up ...,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,What headset is hutch using?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Hey hutch try out haunted hills  they gave it a loot buff when it was already nuts!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I'm a huge fan of how at the beginning of each video  you say: "Sit back  kick your feet up". It really sets the tone for your videos and sets the stage for a really welcoming viewing experience. Each time I hear it  it helps me to just chill and focus on your vid and recognize that you put em up for our entertainment. Loving the Fortnite videos! Take care man,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,not healing to full with that many med kits (even leaving some behind) triggers my ocd way too much xD,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Double pump sicko. cant believe you'd advertise a flawed game mechanic like this to such a wide audience. Anyone who double pumps deserves their own special circle in hell,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Gg but that's what you deserve for choosing an rpg over a shotty lol,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,nice 3 minutes of outro music lol top tier editing,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I love how we grew up watching these guys call people out for what they considered "noob" gameplay tactics in COD  yet they play with game exploits like this with absolutely no shame,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Great song at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,*dies* I am the calm inside the stoooooorm,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,That ending would have been the end of the my controller,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I can't stand the double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Double pump is not that dirty  at least not the way you play. You actually aim which takes just enough time for you to actually negate the exploitive side of the technique. You probably would be better off with just the single pump because of that. It becomes an exploit when some asshole  like me  has shitty aim and just spams it hoping for maximum damage. That exploit is the reason the tactical shotty has been nerfed so badly,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Your apart of the problem you fucking loser. Double pump is aids. Can't wait untill they patch out holding more than one of the same weapon.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,You always say to "kick your feet up" but how can I do that when your gameplay has me at the edge of my seat Hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Dang bush...,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Hutch! Is gay sex gay? Asking for a friend.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Has Hutch been at 920K subs for like 2 years now?? 1 MILL LETS GO !!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,You were robbed of that one :(,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Hutch you gottttaaa stop with these songs at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Tuned in to the stream for exactly one game the other night and it was this one lol,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,play fortnite with sark again pls,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I appreciate you posting videos of you losing  shows me that even the best of us have good games and still lose lol.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Would love if you could posts video of your stats,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Thanks for the Braveheart references.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I have watched your content for many years. Although I do not often have beer available  I do watch your streams with a little margarita or scotch on the regular. Stay classy San Diego.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Glanced at the title and thought it said I'm embracing Donald Trump lol,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,It's been my experience that they don't respond to anything. Their forums are a piece of shit and always down and weird on how they load  and I don't see any responses anywhere. They DO update the game very often and seem to always make nice progressions  but when it comes to revisiting mistakes  I haven't really seen them go backwards too much to redo it  maybe that's just me.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I've stop playing cause of the dubble pump,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,When people start theory crafting the meta of a childrens game marketed toward minecraft kiddo's. Wow.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Took long enough. It's so fun  and really makes you change up your play style.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,So close! :(,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,You got SO lucky at 11:43,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,There was an old shooter called GunZ The Duel  it was all about switching weapons to cancel animations. Too bad it's pretty much dead.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,That ending had my butt so clenched!!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Who's Shaun0728?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Man rockets are just fucking useless  aren't they?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I think they should balance them out by making you have to pump before being able to shoot with each gun. Utilizing a double pump or double bolt-action should be more because you're more skilled and not "exploiting" a skipped animation. I feel robbed when I get double-pumped  but I wouldn't feel robbed if I got double-bolted.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Your mom embraced my double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Oh  this is similar to Bad Company 2's shotgun quick-switching. Dunno what the term used for it was  but I'm sure BC2 palyers remember it very well. Haha. That shit was good. Good thing the devs kept it in the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I'm pretty good at the game but I think I would choke if I tried double pump :/,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,"this feels like an exploit. i don't know why the devs haven't addressed this.... i'm gonna go ahead and use it" stay classy hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,What a video! A+,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Standing water does not curve at the required 8 inches per mile squared to support the globular hypothesis  It is always level. At just 30 miles  a 600 foot drop in curvature should exist yet there is no curvature to be detected. This is one of many proofs that prove the Earth is not a spinning ball. This is NOT a joke or a troll. If you care about truth and the world you live in  spread the word and copy/paste this comment. ~ Peace and love #FlatEarth,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,GG Hutch thought you had that guy too. Rocket was right on,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,You can easily see the disadvantage in CQB once hutch switches away from the double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,No longer a fan of the silenced pistols?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Personally not as excited to watch solo Fortnite runs anymore  as we've seen that Hutch can win on a pretty regular basis and it doesn't seem that interesting/unique anymore. I find the group clips much more fun to watch due to the banter/dynamics  or even just the highlight vids. Wouldn't mind seeing shenanigans with Sark etc. either. Keep up the great  consistent content though Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,My name is Hutch and i make you watch the full commercial cause im a money hungry liberal shit!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,is it me or has hutch been getting pretty beast at this game?! or atleast improved alot!,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,13:04 Here's a little door for you if you want to get in,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,With the double pump  are you adsing? Or just hip firing?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,I guess they see it as  if you want to take up a free slot just to do the double pump  then it's a fair trade off. It's pretty cheesy  but it still puts you at a disadvantage  just to have an upper hand in close combat.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,TWO PUMP CHUMP,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Man i miss that little snippet when hutch got a subscriber or donation where the kid said "lets talk about bitches",Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Surely the easiest remedy to the 'Double Pump Problem' is to simply stop players from carrying more than 1 of each weapon variant in their inventory? Ie  you'd be allowed to carry 1 Tac and 1 Pump  but not 2 of a specific weapon. I know some people like to carry 2 AR's to save reloading in a fight  but realistically it's not a common tactic and I doubt there would be much uproar if that was no longer allowed.. I'm sure they could come up with a better mechanical alternative which prevents the pump animation from being skipped  but for the mean time I see no reason why they couldn't just implement what I said and not allow you to carry more than 1 of each weapon. Thoughts?,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,You double pumping little turd Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
n4XOp4_FuBU,Had to check my other tabs to see if confessions was playing during that intro.,Hutch,shaun0728

I've got a crispy $5.23 donate with your name on it if you play extra long ;)  Edit: Fick has to be the most technologically illiterate person on the planet.

VXT9_uvGXaU,i've played a bit of PUBG  but i gotta say i definitely do prefer Fortnite  for various reasons but mostly as it also gives me that "one more game" feeling i haven't had since World at War on Xbox 360 - to the point that it makes me reconsider being a streamer/youtuber again. i hope somebody who works on this game sees your videos and reads your comments  because they should know that they're doing it RIGHT,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Fortnite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I double pump every night.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Fortnite is what COD used to be- a fun game that is completely balanced  competitive  and allows you to do dumb shit with your friends  or grind for wins. Also Hutch - that snipe at 14:37 ish - dam.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I was in a due game and hutch sniped me it was awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I don't get why people would leave just because you're committing to fortnite. You  to me  have been a personality bigger than and beyond whatever game you're playing since i first started watching you almost a decade ago. Fortnite is definitely a game more fun to play than watch   but i could watch you play angry birds and still get something from it  whether its a laugh or a new  interesting thought.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,The Double Pump is broken as hell and I'm glad they're getting rid of it. The shoot>switch>shoot>switch back>repeat was so annoying to deal with in a close range fight. Now they just need to do something about Tilted Towers and increase the fire rate of the burst rifles......,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,The pump an excuse of a gun. No skill needed. I wouldn't care about the pump if an ar could hit its target 2 feet away . But its got more spread then a gun designed to have spread....,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,WHOA!!!!!  Hell yeah.  lol,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch at the end: "It's over Anakin! I have the high ground!",Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,well that was boring AF to watch. check back in with you when BO4 comes out...,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,My question is how are people comparing CoD to Fortnite? They're two completely different styles of game.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,l e a v e s  g o l d  s c a r,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Would love to see some fortnite GB,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Does anyone have a link to the tweet from the developer?,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,That was the most pitiful collection of opponents. I can't wait till there's a tournament like the one they just did for PUBG.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Play whatever makes you happy hutch  Fuck the cod crowd,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,lol his cam was too zoomed out this game  i was HELLA concentrated on his right hand and how he moved his mouse,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Rip the triple pump,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Continue with the fortnite content  I haven't touched CoD in since I started playing fortnite.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch is honestly like a reverse magpie  He see's a golden weapon and he's just like yea nah fuck that,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Get rid of the scoped rifle too. Gun is useless as fuck,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,YES! That was awesome to watch  keep bringing the gameplay Hutch!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Glad you're enjoying what you do  Hutch. Keep up the good work. Much respect to you and your beard.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I enjoy your fortnite vids man,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,YESSSS fuck double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,fortnite sucks! .,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Showing people how many subs you have on Twitch is basically saying look how much money I'm making...kinda arrogant and idiotic  not something I would do.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I'm only surprised it took the devs so long to get rid of by far the worst aspect of fortnite. With double pumping in the game  I feel like rushing anyone at any point is just tactically stupid  when they might be double pumping. Unless I'm also double pumping  at close range I'm going to be at an extreme disadvantage against a double pumper every single time. Either I land my first headshot with a pump  or they're going to be given like twice as many chances to headshot me in the gunfight. Sure  if I land that first shot and 1HKO them it doesn't really matter if they're double pumping  but I shouldn't have to be a god at the game to outperform average players. It's just stupid. Double pumping so frequently also makes you  Hutch  generally less enjoyable to watch compared to someone who doesn't rely on exploits for wins.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,It beat PUBG for highest concurrent players if you don't care about keeping the constant/medium the same. PUBG's 3m+ player count was on PC only on Steam. Fortnite's was PC  PS4  and Xbone,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch is impressive at CoD  but what I want to see is this man hunting people down  like in Fortnite here. Holy HELL some of his shots are legendary!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,You and Mr Sark are my favorite channels at the moment  keep it up Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,The only thing I miss about you playing cod is the whole omoo thing and watching your gb's. This vids are still awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I've been a fan for the past 6 or 7 years  I've seen you go through hard times and great times  going through a breakup or  joining Machinima.  And even though I started watching because of COD  I enjoy your fortnight videos just as much if not more because I can tell you're enjoying it and having a good time and your videos are really a testament to that.  Keep doing what makes you happy and your fans will stay happy too. p.s. get Nanners into fortnight  would love to see you two play together again.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I am going to be subscribed until you hit a million subs. Even if all you do is rants  I will still keep watching!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch keep doing what you're doing. Fortnite is obviously a big earner for some youtubers (look at Muselk getting like 30 00 YouTube subs a day according to his vids)  and I think you can make this big for you if you keep at it. ya this was a cod channel  bit you're one of the best fortnite players I've seen  and one of the most entertaining. Keep it up  play your heart out (maybe with some of the other tubers with the biggest viewer draws right now) and keep it up my man. You got this,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Fortnight was a godsend for me as well. Tried pubg and it just wasn't my cup o' tea  New cod was just not that great for me and I was sitting here not knowing what to play. Decided to give Fortnight a try and I have to say this is the first battle royale game I can truly say I enjoy playing.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Love the long videos hutch. Still one of my favourite long term YouTube's I've watched you since way before machinima and still watch you to this day. Keep up the good work!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Man  how are people not bored of watching Cod? That shits been getting stale for so fucking long. I still enjoy the scrims because I like to hear you and your boys all shit talking and working together. But we get that with Fortnite and at least its something fresh to watch. CoD should move to every 2 or 3 years so people can stop feeling so burnt out  that or just call it quits.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,It's the model 1887's of Fornite,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,good,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,How much is it to get a Signed Respect the Bish shirt from this man?!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch is my favorite twitch streamer,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch's comment of "What the FUCK?  What are you doing with your life" at around 14:15" made me laugh WAYYYY more then it should have.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Like alway  keep doing what your do and loving what you love to do,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I'd say the double pump is more like the akimbo FMG9 of Fortnite. Aka fuckin' bullshit,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Good fucking riddance.  They handled the double pump situation like clowns.  That bullshit reduces the fun of the game to zero.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,the cod equivelant to the double pump is noob tube x One Man Army Pro in mw2.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Love ya buddy  keep doing you,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I never understood that logic. If it's in the game it can't be an exploit  but if that's the case  then nothing in games can be an exploit because they're in the games. If the animation is longer singularly  and that animation is just gone  completely circumvented  by switching slots and upping the overall rate of fire  I don't get how anyone without a brain injury can sit there and think "Yup  that's purposeful.",Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Double pump=models of mw2,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Keep up with fortnite buddy  love it,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I absolutely understand your feeling of "one more game  one more game" because I'm getting that too with Fortnite. I love watching your gameplays and your commentary. You keep doing you!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I don't get why you keep using wood when you have 999 metal and brick.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,youre a beast at this,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Your stance on the double pump is more offensive to me than your political views /sarcasm  <3,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I was gonna ask why not just make it so you can't have 2 pumps but maybe make the pump available up to epic  then Hutch domed a guy from 40 feet for 106. Guess that's why.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I feel like they could nerf the grey pump pretty hard  and just change the green pump to a blue or purple,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Lol you completely swapped your opinion but I love you Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,i am so sick of fortnite!!!! its gets boring/repetive real quick!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,They are also killing the game by not prioritizing big issues  don't forget that HUTCH.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I like the leaned back vibe this game Hutch. Nice to see you relaxed and happy these days!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I like the fortnite videos,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Rip.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch you killed me in a fortnite game last night  i thought i could trust you man. im unsubscribing,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Always take shield over bandages because you lose the shield first,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,No this is def good news u cheep fuck,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Please upload some WW2 cod Hutch. I m alright with Fortnite  but i reeeeally miss the cod OMOO vids,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Ya just gonna ignore how hyped you were with Rocket League  Hutch??? Ps. Where's the link where the devs talk about ending double pump???,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,When you think that you see an enemy so you yell at your screen "Hutch  to your left!" but then realize its a speck of dirt on your monitor...,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Double pumps are more like the MW2 chopper gunner. You know it's overpowered but that doesn't mean you don't wanna use it. Also you've been getting a lot better at fortnite lately. Try solo squads soon?,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Try the Magnum/Pump. Very similar besides a little more precise shots,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,It's not the noobtube of Fortnite. It's the pre-patch akimbo model 1887s in MW2.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I find ww2 so boring to play. One game and I'm already over it.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Heya Hutch  Just wanted to say that I heard a lot of focus from you on viewer numbers and subscribers. Imo it is rather unhealthy to just focus on numbers alone  and you shouldn't be measuring succes by your subscriber count only. Just a concern from a dedicated Hutchman  Love you <3,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch Is your pickaxe a toilet plunger fused with a katana?,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Good stuff.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Hutch you're still the most badass streamer i watch and probably always will be,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Fortnite is so much more entertaining than WW2.  Keep it up Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,I didn't drink a beer because Hutch didn't tell me too.,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,imo the fact you have to use 2 slots sort of balances double pumps out,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Where hutch goes  I go,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Fortnite gives me the same feeling  always finding an excuse for 'one more game',Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,Absolutely love watching you play this. Keep it up hutchypoo,Hutch,shaun0728
VXT9_uvGXaU,So weird hearing they are getting everything right when if you stop and look at paragon....yea it was good at first but they blew it.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Purple tac :(,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Love that song disarm you...,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,0:54 you essentially just dropped a purple tac for a grey pump :^( it hurts,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,What's with the notepad? Wins  awesome plays? What's the purpose of writing them down?,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Am I the only one that geta annoyed by him saying gas instead of the storm?,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,What about having a minimum arming distance for rockets? Like it has to fly so many meters before it is armed,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Hutch  in your opinion  to be great at this game is it a better idea to be playing on pc? I know its not possible to build like u pc players on console that's for Sure.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,I can't stand the rockets in this game tbh. I don't like the idea of removing them but one thing I hate about BR games right now is investing 20 minutes into a slow game and getting blown up or sniped. The fact that rockets do area damage makes them a little too strong tbh. I realize that's the nature of the weapon haha but I think they're a little too high damage right now,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Am I the only one finds it annoying when the video cuts into the middle of a conversation? "I'm positive I watched it  I'm positive I enjoyed it..." okay  what film?   Sipping a chug jug while your teammate who is on way less health is one thing  but doing it while they're fighting off another team. There's a name for those kinds of teammates.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,I read on a forum post that the Fortnite people have commented on being a good idea they might look into soon  re-balancing rockets to be mainly structure killers as opposed to people killers and I can completely see why. If you're one of the last people in a match vs 1 or 2 other people with rockets while you don't have one  most of the time you are going to have a bad time. They will just build over to you then shoot down at you with their rocket to 1-shot you. I love Fortnite  but weapon balance is extremely poor. Shotguns deal too much damage (a green tier gun dealing over 200 damage in 1 hit? That is ridiculous)  rockets are too easy of a win condition  and I'd have an easier time killing people with my pickaxe as opposed to the silenced SMG which fires like it's aimed by Ray Charles.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Controlled chaos  totally standard.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Love you Hutch!!,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Can you make the nra ads stop or is that an option,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Completely fucking standard!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Imagine when 50v50 comes back and then there are squads of people with the guiding rockets,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Lmao got a JoinNRA Ad on this video just chuckled to myself thinking of hutch getting that NRA money,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Is anyone else extremely hard on themselves for any mistakes they make in this game since deaths are so costly? I could never play with Hutch because I'm just bad at the game I lose every gunfight and can't build very fast at all I don't know what I'm doing wrong.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,6:35 you needed that medkit,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,At the end you did have a jump pad. Could have used it,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Sup Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,On your point of "go do something new"  the band Gorillaz will perform here in Brazil for the first time ever and I'm leaving soon to go see them :D,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Damn that ending was intense,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,why didn't hutch use metal at the end and used wood? seems really stupid,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,WHAT MOVIE.... it skipped.... D:,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,fuck you,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Rockets are best against the common fortnite player but not against pros,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,If there is anything you would take out  what would it be and why?,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,I love the notepad line at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Are you financially literate? Last one  I swear.,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,Notification Squad where you at?,Hutch,shaun0728
WuYuEguwSm8,1st,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,type 100 in London? London indeed is falling,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I also love this type 100  a little on the weaker side which makes me rage  but i deal with it  I just got the Heroic "Checked out 2" variant and i personally reckon the best variant for the type 100. Its damn pretty.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,"Attachment to make a gun shoot faster" = Bump Stock,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Yeah type 100 is a beast glad someone else agrees with me,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I'm so bad at this game. Oddly rainbow six has made me worse at CoD.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I was losing my mind launch weekend trying out different subs.. I feel like the hit detection is soo off  you can see enemys walkthrough bullets and shit. Once i picked up the type 100 the difference was night and day. The gun is not packing a huge punch but the bullets always hits true,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The type 100 in WaW was awesome with extended mags.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Type 100 has the longest range from all the SMGs  so that's why it feels so good even at range. It reminds me of the Peacekeeper from BO2  like an in-between weapon.  Also  according to some data diggers  rapid fire only ups the fire rate with ~5%. Not worth the attachment slot imo  when you have things like Steady aim  advanced rifling  extended mags and high caliber,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Im loving this game so far Fg42 with rapid fire grip and headshot damage,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,For some reason the type 100 is trash for me I ALWAYS lose gun fights but I have yet to get rapid fire so maybe that's the move.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Is the armoured division good,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Piece of shit,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Fuck you hutch.      Jk love ya bro,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Mp40,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I am definitely a fan of the Type 100!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I think I speak for everyone when I say we want to see more omoo gbs.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,i love the type 100,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,the type is my favorite in the game as well. i have an epic variant and it has the same iron sights as this one. sooooo good,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,"I don't fuck around".... lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,acog is clean,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,This game looks and plays the best on the Xbox one x.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Love the iron sites on the type 100. I agree rapped fire is a must for it but besides that it's a smooth gun i feel.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,K,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I love the Type 100 but the Waffe is my favorite by far.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I got the epic variant of the Type 100. The Just. I love it a lot but I use the STG a lot for daily quests mostly with a mountain infantry loadout,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,If you challenge a shotgun user at close range with just about anything  you will win. Shotguns are completely worthless in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The type is great  especially on PC.  Low recoil  easy to control.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,C on this map is literally thee best spawn trap in this game  you sit on those steps and let em come to you  its beautiful,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,i agree with you  best SMG for me is the TYPE 100 and i feel with the silencer makes it even more accurate. rapid fire is a must.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I like how Hutch constantly reminds me that he makes more money than me by sitting on his ass playing games while I have to go work in a factory 6 days a week and 9 hours per shift,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,He goes from sucking their dick calling the game the "best in years" (after calling it the "best in series" during the beta)  to trying to sell their weapon variants for them. This shit is sad Hutch  jesus christ. Hope you enjoy that vacation that activision is paying for.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,anyone else getting error code 1 on xbox? literally restarted 10 times and still nothing,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Road to 1 million !!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,is dtreats still playing with u guys?,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,This game just needs bigger maps and to get its servers completely smoothed out and it's easily one of the best cods,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I loved your chess vids,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,More chessssss!!!!! Plzz,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Type 100 has been the meta since WAW,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,My favourite gun is the Grease gun . IT MEEELTS,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Rapid Fire actually makes sense as a weapon mod. I'm no expert  but you can theoretically install parts that reduce the unlock time and/or increase the speed at which the bolt travels (using a lighter bolt assembly  for example) and this would increase the rate of fire of the weapon.  There are plenty of weapons that have had their rates of fire deliberately decreased for purposes of ammo conservation and control-ability.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The one thing I hate about this game is that you can shoot first  hit someone 3 times and still be the one to die.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,*sigh* when you watch the stream and have already seen this.  I kind of miss a separate gameplay commentary,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Today is my bday and this video  just made it even beter,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,COD just doesn't do it for me ever since I put the battlefield bad company 2 disc in my old ps3. There's something about battlefield games that COD has never had.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Favorite division to use hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Hutch with the clutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,More commentaries please! I like to listen to them while I play!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I tend to bounce between the type 100 and the "thompson" idk what its called in this but yeah. the type 100 is a really solid gun.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Its alright.  Any gun can be particularly deadly in the _right_ hands.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Type 100 is my favorite as well.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Miss the search and destroy game play honestly. It was always more fun to watch as you only had one life and you had to play a lot more tactically with your team instead of rushing every time you die and respawn. Meh :/,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I prefer the Waffe 28 over all else. That gun is a god among SMG's.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I go absolutely insane with the type 100. Feels like I'm cheating at times. Couldn't agree more with you on this.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,"Gun variants are purely cosmetic",Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,WE WANT OMOO,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,TF is the righteous II? I have the blue sky II and the only other one I see is the checked out.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,jesus  I never thought of rapid fire like that  it IS like stopping power. While we're at it  let's throw in Advance Rifling in there for Shotguns. Not only are shotguns utter shit  but advance rifling is like mandatory  leaving you as a shotgun player to basically have 1 attachment at your disposal unless you go primed (why would you?) or infantry (again  why would you?). As a shotgun only player  I'm extremely disappointed with how this game treats the class.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Is there any difference between normal guns and their heroic variants?,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,My heroic zipper II mg42 <3,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,When did having a camera on the person playing become a thing? Seems weird to me.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I've got one heroic variant so far and it's for the fucking M1 Bazooka fml,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Is anybody else absolutely hating this game? The maps fucking suck which is a game ender for me,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The type 100  imo  is the mp7 of mod3. Not as strong as the main smg (pp90m1)  but has no recoil. Which makes it excellent for pubs,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,God this game is such garbage lol,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Hutch  could you commentate over the entire video one of these times? I really enjoy hearing your thoughts on the game and would love to hear more. Thanks man!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Couldn't agree with you more Hutch  Type 100 is a handy little pocket rocket. Slap rapid fire and extended mags on it and you just melt people. All I need is that sexy heroic variant but no luck as of yet.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,There are modifications you can make to a gun to make it cycle quicker.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,How do you get the heroic variants? Is it just luck?,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Hey hutch sry for triggering u on stream  but trump is way better than obama,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,i'm so jealous of that variant! i only play hardcore where the type 100 is hands down the best gun so it's my fav,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,You can swap out the springs to make a gun shoot faster,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,BAR is insane  really easy to play long range fights with it and succeed  but I much prefer to be running around with an SMG and I too love the type 100. I love low-recoil guns and once you accept that its a 6 shot at long range you understand how to use it and it just fucking shreds. Love the guns in this game this year.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Just a response to the Rapid Fire bit  technically yes you can change the cyclic rate of a lot of automatic weapons by varying the weight of the bolt  the gas flow  etc. However this often leads to jamming  so it's not recommended unless the weapon has built in presets for such things. (like changing the choke on a shotgun type of preset not press a button and done),Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,i really like the type 100   one of my favorite weapons,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Listen I play your videos for the first 2 mins when you're properly commentating. I miss you sitting down and taking to us like you used to. If I wanted a live comm I'd tune into your twice. You uploading your twice smscks of laziness which i know you aren't. Please upload full comms. Thanks,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,This game needs ground war! Like if you agree!,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,100% agree hutchy poo. Not sure what it is   but I melt with the type 100 with suppressor and hustle basic training.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The music synced so perfectly with that shot at 2:17,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I agree with you Hutch! Also the combatant variant of the Bren is god like with the right set-up,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Hey Hutch! Great gameplay  very entertaining and sick shotgun kill on 6:47. Keep up the good work. Absolutely love this game<3,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,Type hunnid dope as shit Hutch. My fav SMG hands down.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,type 100 is definitely my favorite as well. It just feels consistent and coherent.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I have the same feelings about the type 100. It was easily the most right feeling weapon for me. Never really felt at a disadvantage for all scenarios. It just doesn't excel at anything. It has no recoil  but it also has not enough fire power to take advantage of it. That being said. It is my  used weapon and highest K/D one as well. First weapon I double prestiged  and I think that it is really fun to play with (shame I can't use it as much to get the dam prestiges done faster),Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I had a hard time with the gun when I first started using it.  Maybe I'll give it another try.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,The stg with rapid fire and grip is basically an op sub with range. Especially if you use infantry so you can strafe faster.,Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,So you can alter the gas system on an automatic weapon to change the fire rate. So yeah rapid fire technically could be a real life weapon "attachment" ;),Hutch,shaun0728
m0HVjV1IvWA,I love this gun and destroy with and your sooooo luccckkyy to get the  righteous,Hutch,shaun0728

A3l32Y4ZRBw,Watching hutch reload his wehampon is amazing!,Hutch,shaun0728
A3l32Y4ZRBw,I've yet to be impressed by him doing anything with the impulse....he still talks about that time when he used one then killed someone with a Deagle.  His version of the story "I basically got a 1 Deag while in the air off an impulse" true story is he built a small ramp  used an impulse to get on top of a small hill  walked about 10 steps  took aim and then got a 1 Deag.,Hutch,shaun0728

A3l32Y4ZRBw,I remember months ago hutch saying he wanted to just become really good at this game. Dude you're really fucking good hahaha.

A3l32Y4ZRBw,the goat,Hutch,shaun0728
A3l32Y4ZRBw,Saw another NRA ad on this :( just wanted to let you know. The ad is so f'ing stupid just like everything they stand for. Honestly I suggest you watch it simply for how dumb it is.,Hutch,shaun0728
A3l32Y4ZRBw,First!!,Hutch,shaun0728
A3l32Y4ZRBw,1st,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Wu Tang  Biggie  2Pac. Nuff said.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,When a live comm starts with him asking who's heard of the verve pipe  its gonna be a good one. Arguably the cheesiest band ever. We were only freshman! I'm sad I missed this video and stream.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,that song made me hurt so good in middle school and high school. hahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,G E N E R A L I Z A T I O N much?,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Didn't know you were such an asshole and close minded for openly calling trash the last decade of good music. Fuck you for real. Unsub.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch - no way was all 90's music terrible... also freshman is a tear jerker.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hey man  quality shit without the webcam. Not that I don't appreciate the bushy beard  but definitely felt the goofier vibe. keep on keepin on,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,90s music was great in the UK and the dance/rave/free party scene was incredible. There will never be another era like it. But we did have the Spice Girls :P  kms,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Wu-Tang clan is from the 90's and they're probably one of the best rap groups ever  so i politely disagree with your statement my good sir,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,yeah Ive heard of the Freshman  it was a good song you dingus,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,*Trigger commences*  VILLIANS (Verve Pipe major debut) WAS A BANGER ALBUM FROM START TO FINISH AND DON'T YOU EVER TALK BAD ABOUT THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!   *Trigger continues forever because 90s music is life*  You want to talk about bad 90s music? Look up Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe. Eesh. Final point: Wounded by Third Eye Blind is one of the best composed pop songs ever written.  *Trigger still continues  but I understand that people have different preferences*,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Aren't you a fan of The Beta Band? They're the first thing that comes to mind when I hear 90s,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Stone Temple Pilots & Pearl Jam... all I have to say,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hell yeah 90s music sucked. The worst band was Radiohead for sure ;) just heard to song at the end of this video loooool some fucking thicc irony.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hey did you hear when a guy on Fox News called Radiohead the poor man's Coldplay?,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Take Bare Naked Ladies and Blues Traveler with you then....cause they were fucking irritating.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,that's just because everything looks pale in comparison to 80s music and that's that.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,@Hutch  Fastball - Sooner or Later  argue with that,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,what happened to the chess vids? :(,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,90s music actually was the greatest if you listened to the good bands and groups,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,You know more lyrics off the top of your head to the songs you dislike/I like,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,saying "it gets a little goofy" starts gameplay with suicide joke perfection lol,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Yo. Hutch. You lowkey love all the bands you mentioned.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,LAWL hutch.... your fucking great. thanks man.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,There's a great AV Club article about 1997 being the worst year for music ever.  https://music.avclub.com/did-1997-contain-the-worst-two-weeks-in-music-history-1798265017  It's pretty spectacular and well worth the read.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch: "This band sucks and if you like it you're wrong." Also Hutch: *Sings top songs from said band*,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Mate... i actually love Freshman. Feelsbadman,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,for someone who hates all those bands... you sure know all their songs..,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,What music do you like?,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Unsubbed. Hutch is falling off,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,I couldn't make it through the song it was giving me cancer,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch may i ask how your dad knows spanish so well? Unless you guys are part Latino,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Saying an entire decade of music was terrible is pretty silly. You must not listen to much music Hutch. Neutral Milk Hotel  Nas  Radiohead  Godspeed You! Black Emperor  Swans  Weezer  Smashing Pumpkins... there was so much incredible music released in the 90s. To say the decade of music in its entirety sucked just means you listened to some bad songs and made a snap judgement based thereon. There is shitty music in any decade. Popular 90s music may not have been your bag  but the music of the decade was anything but shitty.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Rage  alice  primus  soad  flaming lips  modest mouse  green day  sublime   pearl jam  soundgarden   iz you crazy hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,MrGrimmz spotted at @2:53,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Screamed at the top of lungs at the end holy shit howd you not see him!,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,LOL the verve pipe  i swear there are worse songs. oh wait there is "gucci gang" And this is why i miss 80s music.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Literally every band he trashed I listen to on the daily...,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,webcam has to come back,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Fuck Daryl.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Biggest Youtube letdown of 2017? Hutch missing a snipe on a dude that's dancing.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,90's hiphop > todays shite,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch  I see where you are coming from. My favorite bands are 90s bands. We both share Radiohead as our favorite band! But I agree with you. I think that there was more bad 90s music than there was good 90s music. I love Radiohead  The Smashing Pumpkins  Pearl Jam  and Nirvana. The pop music and boy bands was trash though and almost every song seemed to rip off the "grunge" trend that the alternative bands were titled under. Most 90s groups were one hit wonders.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Man I forgot all about the The Verve Pipe lmao!!! That is hilarious!! Could've gone on without the Quantum Leap mention. I hated that show. It was strange & uncomfortable for no reason.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,"90's music was terrible"    This coming from the guy who listens to fuckin' dubstep,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Darryl sounds like a douche,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Feels like you're maybe riffing more than when you have the facecam. Very enjoyable.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,if you ever make a statement like that again i will most definitely punch you in your neck,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Yeaaaah  I'm with you on this one Hutch  good to get you through the times  20/20 on it can fucking shut the fuuuck up. Also digging no cam Hutch  you seemed much more laid back,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,this must be an old gameplay because hutch of now would have sniped the guy at 13:10 instantly,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,My sister almost married the drummer from a Verve Pipe. His name was Doug  he was cool.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,legitimatly can i just say you sark nanners and apl need to set aside one night a week for csgo   that video was the greatest thing ive seen on youtube in a while,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,I just want to say i love u Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,I enjoy that song,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,And i subscribe just as you die.... Feels like its my fault...,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,I've always thought that 80's music was superior to the 90's.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,No Hutch  please. Not the 90s. My beloved 90s.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,@hutch you do know the lyrics to alot of shitty songs....hmmmm,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Don't forget how horrible semi sonic- closing time was too lol,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch  I could stand you not liking Verve Pipe. But seriously  MB20. I now really believe you're just a broken terrible human being at this point.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,also disregarding all the great 90s rock metal and hip hop mentioned in the comments what about 90s electronic music? the prodigy  daft punk  the chemical brothers  faithless  massive attack   moby the list goes on!,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,60s music is where its at,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,I deal with your political views bc your vids are good but taking a shot at 90's music may be the last straw,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,There is no way you can say the most influential decade in music is terrible  Your opinions are irrelevant,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,That random rant at the begining is awesome XD. Hutch just made a rewally good character description of this Deril. Almost like he knows the guy <.<,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,joking about suicide is not funny  especially this time of the year when people be fucked up. just saying. pretty tasteles content.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,That damn Superman song  man there was soo many songs to hate from Alternative scene. Glam rock was pretty bad during that decade too. Sorry been a raver since 93 and still hated all touchy-feely stuff with cry-baby lyrics.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,it was the golden years for those of us who likes hip hop,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch singing is like a morph between Jack black and jesus.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,look at this GRAPH,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,How do you say you hate it but you know the lyrics word for word. Also there are great hip hop artist that emerged or got big in the 90s  Jurassic 5  Pete Rock  Pharcyde etc. I think you should of put the title as "90s alternative rock is trash",Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,If you had nailed that snipe on the dancing guy...,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,one im just glad you didnt toss Nickelback in there because they were heaven sent. and B the fact that the guy who killed you had the word Cucked in it made this for one of my all time favorite videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Green Day  The Offspring  Sum 41  Rage Against the Machine  Alice in Chains  Pearl Jam  Chili Peppers  Matchbox Twenty.... I could go on for so long. Y HUTCH  Y U DO DIS!!?!?,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hey Hutch  I just wanted to say thank you for making videos. I really love your style and it's rare to find content creators who are so chill and self aware as you are. I really love unwinding and watching your videos. Thank you for being you. Cheers-  A fellow Internetorian,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,dude i can not comprehend how you are so successful despite all the things you dont notice! you got sniped at twice and you didnt realize it towards the end of the game and somehow you didnt die from it,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,God that freshman song sucks lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,60s= goat 70s = second best 80 = trash 90s = better than 80s 2000s = garbage 2010s = we'll see,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,considering you have "fitter happier" tattooed on your arms  you can't hate 90s music THAT much..,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Play some cod you fat bastard,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,If I remember correctly your favorite Radiohead hit it's stride in the 90's,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hell ya Hutch!!! You beat Mr.Grimmmz @2:51,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,For someone that hates the song  you really know the words,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Duuuude those were some lit snipes. Love the fortnite vids!,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,It's also good to remember that early 90's was pretty different from late 90's in terms of music (different genres split that distinction up even further. No matter the era you'll be able to find some terrible songs as well as gems.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Pearl Jam is god tier but other than that I have to agree,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,90s music was incredible. *Popular* 90s music was terrible (except for Nirvana obviously).  Compare The Verve Pipe to fuckin... Gucci Gang  or Lil peep  or whatever trash Nikki Minaj is pumping out these days. Is it worse? I don't think so.  Also FUCK YOU  Third Eye Blind is fucking great. The catchiest song about crippling drug addiction ever made.,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,10:55 damn that turnaround,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Hutch is third eye blind for missing the guy at the end,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,You obviously did not listen to the right artists...,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,"Marooned on an empty  lonely island" that a sneaky Pendulum reference  Papa Hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
UX67kUAGWwo,Rage Against The Machine?,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,9:35 look @ his response build time when he almost placed in the wrong spot. He built three platforms mid jump... as a console player  I miss having mouse + keyboard.,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,I don't know about a staff vape. I'm sure it's possible. I did definitely blueprint a pimp cane vape though.,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,Shame you gave into Fortnite. Subs have gone down. Views haven't grown anymore than where they were. It's a shame. Your channel. Do what you want..but it'd by nice to still have some cod. Or even something other than 98% Fortnite. Including streams. Diehard cod fans are leaving. Again your decision. Just disappointing.,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,I like the full games. Please more with Xcal,Hutch,shaun0728

TJxweNreAkA,Which British Prime Minister was it Hutch? That is amazing if true!,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,I've always loved the kill stealing argument  do people who complain about it want the other person to just look at the guy and not shoot? The way I see it is that Hutch hits more % or his shots so he will get the final blow. Feel it bitches,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,Quick reminder that it is in fact true that whenever Hutch plays with Xcal  he does poorly. Exhibit A: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAeiaWnBFtU,Hutch,shaun0728

TJxweNreAkA,March for our lives lol. What a sham,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,Glad I'm not the only one experiencing that stupid gun-switching glitch. Soooo irritating when it gets you killed during combat.,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,The bug you were talking about at 14 mins happens me on PS4 hutch. Go back to your axe and then you can go to your gun again hutch really annoying !!,Hutch,shaun0728

TJxweNreAkA,The ending is like watching a pride of lions play with their food before it they finally decide to kill it hahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,did hutch get a hair transplant?,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,man those guys are relentless towards you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,14:00 I play on ps4 and I have been getting the same bug for the past 1 or 2 weeks  it happens like every 5 to 10 times I try to switch my weapon  I love fortnite but until they fix this I refuse to play.,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,Holy fuck xcal hutch and sandy playing fortnite  middle school me is getting all gitty,Hutch,shaun0728

TJxweNreAkA,dad,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,Hutch got me pregnant,Hutch,shaun0728
TJxweNreAkA,First?,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,"... I'm a feminate." I think you meant "effeminate."   Never thought I'd see the day where I'd be a grammar correcting twat hole  but here we are.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,A feminate? A feminate?!? The word is effeminate.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Four older sisters explains everything  he has had liberal feminism shoved down his throat,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Just picturing you playing this game with a Captain American skin with a shield on his back. That would be AWESOME !!!,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Sooo much double pump,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Not the best edit I've seen. The abrupt ending felt like a spoiled orgasm :(,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,You can only have so much clips of you yelling fuck  balling your fists and looking into the camera. Could do with a bit less imo,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,I enjoy watching hutch and nanners playing pub g.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Hairline coming back strong  just out of respect for this manly specimen.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Are you implying that im a feminate?,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,dirty,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Make some more COD WW2 videos. Tired of Fortnite.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,that last clip...ermahgarwd,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,The drunk play last night was actually... Ok.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,I appreciate the punchy cadence of your swearing...,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Hutch: "I'm the baby boy" H3CZ: "Oh that explains soooo much"  You gotta love Hezc sometimes. That killed me.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Hutch you have inspired me to start streaming  and making highlight videos of myself playing Fortnite. I have been a fan since before the Machinima days! So happy to see you are still doing it!,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,everytime hutch puts out his arms and hands drink,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,I feel like too much of these highlight videos are dedicated to screw ups and bad gameplay. I watch your stream fairly regularly  I know there is a plethora of good material in those vods  but these videos don't really show that as much as they should. I think it would be funny to have an occasional blooper reel of misses and terrible gameplay decisions (because those happen too of course) but to meld them together is just odd feeling.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,6-foot  7-foot  8-foot HUTCH!,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,The worst team I've seen so far XD,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Its good when you win but fuck .. its funny when you lose lol,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Love the editing on these.  Minor quibble - Could Hutch have been calling himself "effeminate" at 9:47?  I didn't take that as a mess-up on Hutch's part  as the editor seems to be asserting in the caption.  Hutch has a pretty expansive vocabulary  so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt there.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,HUTCH IS ONE OF THEM THAR FEMINATES,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,is it just me or did Camchu kill you a bunch of times?,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Karrisa it's "effeminate",Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Sorry  Karyssa  but you gotta show that whole fight at 0:30. It was pretty epic.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Looks like it was a rough week of poor ol' Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,You're like an addiction hutch. I must have my daily dose.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,I wonder if Hutch still likes comments like how I still always like his videos.....,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,"Are you implying that I'm *a feminate*"  A feminate,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Hutch I like your video's because you are honest. Keep it going. You also have skills like a mad man.,Hutch,shaun0728
9DHKuhpjJiE,Loved the immediate fail after Diesel's trademark "Are we just better than them  Hutch?" callout.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,this is when i quit the game and i havent played for 2 months,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Can't get with your complaints. So basically your issue is that lower level players will play each other  where they actually have a chance to get better at the game  rather than getting party stomped?,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I thought I was going mad >.< Went from a steady 2.5 kd and then struggled to go positive. Thought there was something wrong with me and haven't enjoyed WW2 for days.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I mean the game is not really that entertaining to play Hutch  Your probably just doing it for the fans  gaming with 4-6 top players regularly can ruin your own game play also. I know personally as a guy that loved rocking clans. I did not see them as a threat... in fact the better they were together  the easier they were when separated.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Just a casual gamer hear bit this makes me feel better that I'm not losing my fuckin mind.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Connection should be the priority for any fps pvp match,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,My problem is why won't they just tell us? I just assume it's because it IS Heavily Skill based and they don't wanna say anything,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Yo @hutch whats ur sensitivity in ww2???? Plez answer,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,"I am so good at video games" hahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,The comments already say it  and Hutch said it  but yeah SBMM is 100% a fucking thing. I float around a 2kd and I now can hardly find a lobby that isnt sweaty virgins head glitching with BARs. Went to my bro's house yesterday who sucks  and every lobby was insanely easy and full of noobs.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Random question  anyone know if you pick up a gun variant off the ground  do you get the xp boost from it?,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,There's a video on my boyfriend's channel (Quoteunquot3) of him playing on 2 different accounts. One with a 1.30  the other with a 0.75  the lobbies were entirely different. He's convinced SBMM is in this game regardless of what Sledgehammer says based on the matchmaking difference between those two accounts.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,you ever had the thought that maybe everyone else got better?  People learn the maps and play smarter...  Everyone learned that you can use the bar and play like a bitch the whole game because the sub-machine guns are pretty wack so you can't even counter the dickheads sitting in windows and buildings the whole game,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,You had to know sbmm was going to be in it. Pay to win is coming next,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,So basically you want to play every game with a k/d of 3.00? Is it not way more fun to have kind of a challenge against you  better players etc?,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,The net coding  dodgy hit boxes  wonky aim assist  illogical SBMM.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,My kd was a reasonable 1.30 but now it's droppped to a 1,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Wish Hutch did a commentary for a full video...,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Played ww2 and have a 1.01 KD with trying hard to go positive every game. Popped MWR in and went 30-6 first game lol just goes to show you the difference,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I play on the xbox one i have 2 days 10 hours i play by myself and it only puts me with ppl that are prestige 1 and lower. Is this a ps4 only issue cuz it has dlc month early and majority of players are on there?,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,hutch once goat  always goat. dont trip as long as your keeo your neural connections fresh and used why wouldnt you be good at cod. def match making changed youre not the only one going through this,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,It's not just the SBMM. It's really hard to get good at a game when the maps are clusterfucks of retard sight lines with no real structure or flow. The maps are fucking dreadful. There's no way of learning. There's no way of improving. A majority of the time it's RNG  whether you check left first or right first  the maps aren't designed to be friendly to smart players. It's shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I've been matching with 90% super sweaty tryhards since day 1 on PC,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Oh good... It wasn't just me and my bff! PC version has some terrible server issues! Stupid fucking hit box issues that make quick scoping stupid easy! This could of been such an amazing game  and once again just doesn't feel good again! I really miss BO1 now though! =(,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,something has changed...I've been noticing it since black ops 3. There's a new breed of retards that play this game. I don't even mean shitty players I just mean players that look for the easiest most ridiculous way to get kills. Back in the old days of cod it felt like everyone wasn't afraid to challenge themselves and use everything. I don't ever remember going up against an entire lobby iof sweaty people using m16s in cod4 but in MWR people want that quick killing satisfaction so they think they're good. Anyway aside from my highly subjective opinion the declining in skill in older age I think is true. I'm only 24 and I feel like I'm in a room full of hyper active children when I play cod now a days.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,games Fucked,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Further reading the comments has me scratching my head. I haven't played CoD in a minute  but y'all need to find different things that relax you. I think mercenary mode is the best from old CoD for this  and gets the closest to what people want. Randoms playing together. People complaining they aren't dropped into lobbies where they get to poop on everyone is really whiny to me. lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,What's odd to me is the mentality you want to play a game where you go up against other real people trying to beat you  and want to relax doing it. xD I somewhat get it  but it is still weird.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I have the same issues  most matches are super competitive and if I'm not trying my best I get destroyed.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I like the sbmm. The rest off you guys are just noobs who dont play the obj.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I am little above average player(1.10 k/d) and I play only at weekends. Last 2 weekends I could have like 2.0+ kd every second or third game. This weekend I have a lot worse connection but also I do a lot worse. I am bareley positive almost every game.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,This exactly explains why I would stomp scrubs on my girlfriends account as opposed to my account.. I truly believe SBMM is in the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Post more Game battles,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,get gud,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,If I had to guess  SBMM was probably always in the game  people just didn't have enough time played during the first week for the hidden matchmaking algorithm to work as (they) intended. Either way  the game is shit,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,get good,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,has been a thing since day 1  my friend and I both have a kd of 1 roughly  after playing for about the same amount of time  however whenever im in a lobby with him (hes better than me) I get shat all over and struggle to get a kill. Most mm games have a background skill rank even in unranked as it should provide better and closer games.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Can someone tell me what gun he is using,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I don't think that they have SBMM however I have noticed that in a mode like hardpoint  the skill level of the average call of duty player has just gone up. This franchise has been around for a decade now. Not to mention that at the casual level  there isn't a huge skill gap  even more so in BOTG. I feel after the first of december (when ranked play releases) that will help tone down the level of sweating in pubs.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,The one thing I hate the most is seeing people cry about how their 3 KD is now falling and they can't pub stomp anymore. SBMM or not  if you can't do well against good players then you're not a good player. Smashing the same crappy kids over and over is fun  but if you're complaining and boycotting a game because you're getting matched up with good players now  go reverse boost or play a different game.   The way I look at SBMM is  the below average players have a chance now. They can do well; they can get their streaks. It's fun for them. Yes it hurts the hardcore players but maybe they can get better as well playing good players.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I'm 36 and thought I'd had it too haha they have defo done something in the past 5 days or so struggling to go much more than positive,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Ever heard the phrase "pick on someone your own size " these you tubers need to stop complaining that they know actually have to try to get good games. Not everyone plays this game 100 Hours a week,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,You can see developers trying so hard to narrow the skill gap as well. It started way back when they removed pro perks in the game. That way every has the same exact perks. Then they made it so instead of unlocking weapons by level  you just unlock it immediately if you buy it. Then they brought in weapon variants to lessen the skill gap even more and bring in randomness. Then they started making these trash ass maps with no rhyme or rhythm at all  20 different ways to get shot from behind or the side  all kinds of headglitches. Then they had to take away perks and create a class altogether and make divisions. You can't really set up a class how you want at all  you gotta play a very specific way. GARBAGE.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I dont care when anyone says there is 100% SBMM. I only have a 2.3 KD in this game  this is almost lower than my AW KD which was a 2.2 (after 2 prestiges when I quit and sold the game). I am a really good COD player who has been playing since Mw2 there is no way I'm getting destroyed this easily and fast. A bunch of drop shotting  head glitching  jump shot virgins.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,All of these videos have one thing in common. It all people who think they are pretty good at this game who are now bitching because instead of being able to just wreck kids and drop 30 kills a game they now have to actually try and play good. Sure its fun for you to run around and blast the crap out of some 12 year old who just bought the game 2 hours ago  but how fun do you think it is for him to get killed 20 times and only get 5 kills. News flash its not. I know what the real problem is. Its really hard for you to keep that positive KD with all of these players that are on the same skill level as you huh? Guess your not as good at this game as you thought you were.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Hutch i miss you on machinima,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Cry a little more you pansy ass snowflake.  Guess what  the game mechanics in WW2 are simple. So an average player can do quite well if they take things slowly. My kd is 1.5 and I'm still getting in lobbies with 2.5kd and 0.5kd players. That's the same as how it was for me in IW and BO3. Option 3  the community has gotten better and the game is more simple than previous years.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,What if everyone else got better? If a load of the people who just play the game for 2 hours on launch and then quit have stopped playing and everyone else who's had work and school have properly gotten to grips with the game then its possible.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Yea I felt this way to lol,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,So I know I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this but screw it. I'm one of the noobies out there  I have a .71 kd and if there is sbmm i'm ok with it. All of you good players who are complaining about going against the sweats  imagine that x100... noobies don't even get a chance to get out of their spawn half the time because of the sweats. You don't even really get a chance to learn or get better when you're getting spawn camped. Also pretty much every game with multiplayer has some form of skill based mmr for their normal games so I don't see why CoD shouldn't have it either.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,SBMM is a thing and it is another bullshit way that COD caters to noobs by not putting good players in their loobies  leave SBMM to ranked play and leave pubs to the casual game it should be and not a 24/7 sweatfest.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,It's not you everyone I know feels the same way. If you don't try hard you lose in my lobbies :(,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,All I play is War now,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,yeah they definitely did. First week I was wrecking  this week I'm struggling to get above a 1.50 in matches.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I empty clips into others but get get done over in 2 or 3 shots i really dont understand it because the maps are so cramped i get 7 hit markers and then they run around the corner and just pop out to end me in 2 bullets.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I never cared about sbmm tbh and I generally enjoy tryharding. There's now this huge response and backlash about sbmm I see.. my sub box has quite a few ppl talking about it  nvm twitter etc. I feel ppl get caught up in this outrage and will run around a corner  lose a quick gunfight and its "OMFG SBMM FUCK YOU SLEDGEHAMMER" ... when really they are missing shots or playing like an idiot.  It's an fps... it's cod... a day 1 noob can still ads at a corner and kill you. I'm not saying sbmm doesn't exist  just that everyone will enter every game looking for it now. I'd love a developer to say that there IS sbmm when there really isn't. The troll would be great and see how much ppl actually tilt themselves into playing differently.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,People know the guns and maps now QQ if you don't want to play against "sweaty players" quit being such a "sweaty player" yourself,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,the matchmaking is ridiculous. sweaty lobbies,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Also there was an update today idk what the patch notes are,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Dude they added sbmm for sure I noticed it as well,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,My sexual performance  that was hilarious,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,They have definitely turned on SBMM  i went from being a 25-35 kill a game tdm player carrying the team. Now everyone has 15-20 kills and every game is super close,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I find it funny. No more youtubers looking for easy lobbies to pretend they are amazing. All of them crying about it. Ha ha fucking ha. I dont mind going 30 for 30. Rather have a decent close game than one sided game where everyone leaves. I'll bet we dont see many more ww2 videos here unless of course they back down from all the whinging cry babies who like to pretend they are great.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Sledgehammer said that its ping based   stop spreading these lies,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Hutch embrace the truth. You are getting old and you SUCK! jk :D,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Maybe it's just because I'm in hardcore going for all Diamond at the moment  but I'm just not feeling it.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I kind of miss the 3-5-7 kill-streaks. Now it feels like 15-25-35.. minute kill-streaks.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Reverse boosting incoming woohoo,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,Sit back  kick your feet up and enjoy the other half of the video I've not just talked through!,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,People seem to forget that contracts is a thing and people are trying hard to complete them as you get rewards and even bigger rewards for completing all daily contracts LOL nope people jump straight too SBMM!!!  P.S. God forbid People trying to win the game and not giving you kills like candy lol,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,I think they are putting a handicap on players.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,insane match. wpwp,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,well then,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,HUTCH the skill based lobbies are not for you  you know that. its for kids that are bad or new and keep getting stuck in game with good players and getting shit on over and over. it is not fun to have a guy on the other team that seems to have god mode on because he is just so much better then you,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,No doubt SBMM is somewhat on in this game  i'm amongst the best players in the small competitive community that is Argentina and have played numerous ball sweating tournaments as a result. As such  i've had an easy time in pubs for the first couple of weeks in full Argentinian lobbies and perfect connection. Lately i've come to find myself in USA pub lobbies made up of what I assume are GB or pub stomp teams. This takes a hit on both my connection and my ability to fully chill when fucking shit up in pubs.,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,How old is Hutch then?,Hutch,shaun0728

JgB1iy22pg4,Sit back  kick your feet up and AD enjoy the video,Hutch,shaun0728
JgB1iy22pg4,So you are complaining about the game preventing new or poor performing players from getting constantly slaughtered? You're mad that you now have to use more skill to play at players of similar performance? Why is that a bad thing? Sorry you can't ruin people's games now. Good to know you your declining sexual performance is linked to call of duty.,Hutch,shaun0728

BhLEk62AdpQ,If Hutch tells you to sit back and crack open a beer  you do it. And you will enjoy the video doing so.,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Hey Hutch! Ive said it many times before and ill say it again  THANK YOU for giving us great content and just being a down to earth guy who enjoys the intellectually stimulating conversations that pop up regularly. If it weren't for those conversations you and the guys have or the ones you have with us in the chat  I would've never learned to stick up for what I feel is right and not let anybody else tell me what I had to believe in or whether things I believe in personally are right or wrong. Discovering your channel during the extremely crucial period of our lives we call "growing up" could not have been any better timed. I could've turned out to be a real close-minded shit head with the family that I was raised by. But as I continued watching your videos over the years I could literally see a progression in my thought process and reasoning and I can't thank you enough for that! So again THANK YOU my friend and for as long as you love it  keep up the hard work man!,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,PUBG is way more intense  you won't be able to handle it old man lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Hutch really is the worst with call outs. "Over here" isn't an understandable direction. Haha.,Hutch,shaun0728

BhLEk62AdpQ,Got my beer... Excellent video Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Unpopular opinion  i enjoy both games in their own rights. Fortnite is a very chill atmosphere where if i win  it's not a big deal. PUBG has a much more tactical play style that has me enter a competitive mindset to get the Chicken Dinner. I win less on PUBG  but those wins just taste so much sweeter.,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,hutch is the man we didn't deserve but got anyways :'),Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Quality,Hutch,shaun0728

BhLEk62AdpQ,I'm sorry about your cat Hutch  my cat passed a few years ago and it was really hard on me.  I still think about her everyday and it still makes me cry.  Its not an easy thing to go through  animals are like family and we feel their losses just the same.,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Thank you so much for these past years  Hutch. We all appreciate you,Hutch,shaun0728

BhLEk62AdpQ,Fort nite may win and should win game of the year,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,yer pubg the scarcity is too much  like the randomness was good  but this game you can have a worse gun but it will atleast be usable  pub g a fair amount of the time u end up with next to no chance of winning just because where u dropped and u start the game with less than even a pistol  where as fortnight its like "fuck i only got a white ar",Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Swear I watched this before? And it wasn't on twitch lol,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Shit. That ending gave me chills!,Hutch,shaun0728

BhLEk62AdpQ,Pro tip hutchy poo  wood walls have higher health while being built so when you're panic building using wood walls is better than metal but build structures with metal  Pce and love,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Sorry about your cat man sorry I'm belated on that it really really sucks to see a animal you love die. I remember I came home with my dog Cody  which my family had for almost 19 years  was laying next to the tree in front of our house and I knew his time was comming but just seeing him after comming home to a happy dog for so long broke me. There are more stories that are like that for me so you aren't alone bud,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Hey HUTCH  in a emergency situation use wood structure they build faster  so they basically got 2 bar of health (When building and when done). When you want to build a base use stone and metal.,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,shoutout to hutch for giving me a way to procrastinate during finals week,Hutch,shaun0728
BhLEk62AdpQ,Got to agree with hutch. I enjoy this game far more than PUBG. Condolences for the passing of your furry friend  my friend.,Hutch,shaun0728

mfH5DsDivCE,i've always prefered full games from you Hutch. your conversations are even better than your gameplay. especially on OMoO vids. 1 000% <3 U,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I think that the video clips could be longer  more context. also we watch it not only for the gameplay but for the commentary  which we dont get with this  so maybe clip some of that stuff too. Transitions are a little annoying  but I could get over them if they didnt change. just my feedback.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I think the main thing that could improve the transitions would be to just use straight cuts between consequential clips from the same game  but then use transitions between different rounds of the battle royale. This would make the video a little easier to follow for context  and might reduce the common transitions which everybody seems to be complaining about.   Just my two cents though  enjoyed the video as always!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Your kicking ass hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I like the longer  less edited videos more. They're more intimate and easier to masturbate to.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I think the sliding edits take away the flow of the video.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,For multiple clips like this  I understand the need for transitions  but it feels a little half-hearted to me. I don't mind screen transitions as a concept. Let us make that clear right now. It's the execution here I take a little issue with. A horizontal screen wipe is one of the most basic transitions there is  and while not a bad one  there are so many clips in this single video that constantly repeating the same horizontal wipe becomes very noticeable and oddly irritating.  I feel like this can be solved in a few ways. Let us assume the overall video length is the same. Let us also assume you and/or your editor wants to keep the same horizontal wipe. The individual clips themself can be longer  thus solving the repeated transition being so prominent. The other option is to have a shorter video and keeping the clips at their current length.  Perhaps I am just being entitled  but I prefer something a little more appropriate to the clipshow format shown here. The wipes are appropriate  but underwhelming. This is an age where we get those who are masterful editors like Sark  and it's spoiled people like me. If you want to keep the clipshow format for future videos  I do not mind  but I suggest the transition be changed. I find the two most common transitions are screen static with a short audio static mp3  like eatmydiction1 does for his "Dic clips"  or cut to a sort of screen. Some people cut to something akin to an interrupted broadcast screen between clips in a clipshow  and a popular one is from the Fallout games.  That's my 2 cents.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,7.7 ring a bell Henry?,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,That effing end though. I know that feel Hutch my Man,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I liked this video a lot Hutch  keep 'em coming. Something about this game is just so fun to watch,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,This video was complete garbage Hutch  sub par by far. Too many cuts and could not enjoy it at all. We don't care if you die or not just show it all and get another match. When you cut everywhere we have no idea what happened in each of the matches. I like the long hutch vids anyways,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Song at end of video?,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Can you not upload cut vids please  keep doing what you were doing with uneditted clips they are far more enjoyable for my "Hutch Time" of the day,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,WHO*,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I like it  editing is good too. Transitioning is nice and not distracting whatsoever lol,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,That last clip hurt my insides lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Some criticisms: definitely too many short clips in the beginning. Fortnite requires context about engagements  so it doesn't really do well to have a montage of clips from separate games. The wipes were a little cheesy. Also  I think it's just better to have a single game or two stitched together. I will say though  it was cool to get a little highlight reel of some of your games  it's nice for the people who don't watch your streams. But  if you're gonna make a video like that  make it just one or two game highlights  It was a good test run for your new editor  and that's fine,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Diesel   karma  hutch and bigT should play as a team,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Love how the plays just get more and more clutch towards the ending.  edit: just watched the ending. lols,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Hutch did you end up hiring an editor? If so it looks great  and still has a hint of your style.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,you know it is super intense when the only thing you can hear from Hutch's mic is the sound of the keys on the keyboard,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,This Henry dude is ass lol,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Keep the intros Hutch! Otherwise I like the video  maybe a full original gameplay would be better than a stream rip? Regardless love your content  don't ever leave us Papa Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I don't like this new editors quick transitions,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,That last clip was aaaaaids,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,This general style is great  with the highlights instead of full games. Glad you've got someone doing this now  but the editing is nothing spectacular. Mainly just matching up clips it seems like  not sure what you're looking for though!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Who the fuck moans about screen transitions? If I was the editor I'd start doing star wipes and stuff you'd see in some cheesy wedding video just to fuck with them.  Content as always Hutch is great. Happy you switched it up for this vid.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Lol the screen transitions seem fine tbh. Idk how you get distracted by them like some of these people are saying.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,love the random singing haha,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,i dont mind the editing but i enjoy the whole videos better,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I love the game  but the shooting is just ass.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,is it just me or are the full games with the commentary at the start  a lot better than this,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Rekt,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I just failed so hard at this game... it's on my channel,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,It's cool you got an editor but I agree with the people saying less transitions. Looks kinda weird and feels out of place in an otherwise good video. Either way keep em coming hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I enjoy the full games better.,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,It's great that you've got an editor now  but please tell them to use fewer screen transitions  it's distracting and isn't necessary. Keep up the good content Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,I do,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,HEY GUYS HUTCH HERE  100 LIKES AND I WILL POST A LINK OF MY PENIS IN THE DESCRIPTION OF MY NEXT VIDEO!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,HEY GUYS HUTCH HERE  100 LIKES AND I WILL POST A LINK OF MY PENIS IN THE DESCRIPTION OF MY NEXT VIDEO!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,HEY GUYS HUTCH HERE  100 LIKES AND I WILL POST A LINK OF MY PENIS IN THE DESCRIPTION OF MY NEXT VIDEO!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,My god 4:16 made me jump.  I also like that you've got yourself an editor now for your highlights  more videos for us AND more stream time too :),Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,Some constructive criticism  I see someone else edited and not trying to throw shade at him  but there are far too many wipes and they could probably be done a little better  it's just very distracting and a little corny I feel  other than that  I very much enjoy the fortnite vids,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,The best chill place on YouTube,Hutch,shaun0728
mfH5DsDivCE,first lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,nice radiohead shirt!,Hutch,shaun0728

uWswTN-4BgA,Hutch no offense dude  love your videos and streams but you ok? Your arms seem very skinny.,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Even though hutch doesnt have a large viewership  he has a lot of infulence in the gaming world. and I just wanted to note that here,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Bringing back the old in rainbows shirt for machinima. Nice.,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,The walking in this game looks incredibly obnoxious,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,i feel like i'm watching a chevy commercial,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Mail time with hutch videos for the YouTube channel  new series or just commentaries  we need more than fort nite streams related back here!,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,You're such a great host Hutch. I could see this type of setting/content in your future.,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Hutch would make a great host of something like this. Great vid Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728

uWswTN-4BgA,wow hutch you seem so happy and full of energy in this video :D,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,No offense but this may be the worst video you've ever posted.. Could barely see the game and too much focus on looking at you in front of a green screen..,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,This game looks sick!,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Damn that production value,Hutch,shaun0728

uWswTN-4BgA,Been trying to watch your pubg stream from a few days ago on twitch but for some reason never works. First world problems!!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,You still make videos?,Hutch,shaun0728
uWswTN-4BgA,Wow  Machinima let you back in? ;),Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Has Hutch stopped playing PUBG totaly? :O,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,That 1HP drop haha,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,dont reuse clips bro,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,What happened to your hair..,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,LOL! These PC games r so bad! Looks like COD games 10yrs ago. Can't watch this garbage.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,You should create a compilation of all of your "Whoa!" and "Ahhh" reactions! Highlights are awesome Hutch; I get to see some of the best stream moments which I'd usually miss out on seeing!,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hutch buddy i used to watch you way back in the day like years and years ago when call of duty was a thing  i think if you want to revamp your popularity you should go to pc and maybe try to play games with jerico he plays PUBG and games like that it might be a good swap meeting up with the older people that were playing from your time and everyone can watch you playa new format and get better im sure you will be accepted,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Calling you "Hitch" might catch on.  Hope your Hallows Eve is a ghoulish one  Hutchy O'Pal!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Your editor uses PowerPoint?  Just kidding  just kidding  it's okay :),Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,I feel like people dont understand what hes trying to do  Hes trying to please the 2 huge groups that watch. Yes this has reused clips but its for the people who dont like to watch Full gameplay. So to those people these are all new clips. If your like me and love the full gameplay then just skip the highlight videos. Keep doing you Hutch. Love the videos as always,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Loving these highlight vids hutch.  I'm hopelessly addicted to this game.  Good shit buddy,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,How about a full gameplay with a commentary about your life and how everything is going or maybe something that you'd like to speak about? Like the good old days Who agrees?,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Love you dude  but those reused clips are brutal.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,I'd rather watch whole matches. Part of the excitement of seeing a win is seeing everything that went into getting it.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hutch  keep doing what you love to do how you like to do it. Those who complain and leave despite you doing your best to diversify (and explaining about it in the last video too) are not people worth keeping anyway.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,I don't mind the idea of stream highlights  but I think they could include a few more funny moments vs. all action moments. It's good for us to see the action-y parts  but with the disconnect of not seeing the full game  it's fairly disorienting. I would personally like to see a little more banter between you  the chat  and your teammates  if possible. I think that would help to level things out a little and make it less of a kill-to-kill-moment vibe. I think this video is starting to show some of that  but I still think it could be bolstered a bit. Just my two cents. Keep on keepin' on  Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Stop streaming this shitting game and banning children in your chat for no reason.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Please make a "lowlight" reel I love watching people fuck up in this game lol,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Damn that aim is bad lol,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,I feel like I'd get more enjoyment watching full games edited down. Not a highlight montage in a way. Could probably mash 2 or 3 matches in one like that,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,I like these but I too prefer full matches Hutchy. #feedback,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hutch is like the greatest loot whore ever,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,"I don't want that"..... walks through all of it.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hutch you can't upload a full length gameplay and then use the good clips from it in your next highlights video  that is just lazy.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hitch lol,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,good shit Hutch  im loving the variation,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Great vid man! Dont care if it a montage or a full game ;) its just awesome:):),Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Full games please. Clips are fun but I like to see a full game play out.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Hutch give us some OMOO matches!,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,A man is thirsty for a full game,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,Yeet.,Hutch,shaun0728
c9tGSvf1vCg,First?,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Damn hutch is selfish as fuck.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Scumps better already,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch man you're the king of Fortnite  but god damn your selfish af.  The ending was well deserved on your part.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Solo carry syndrome,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch not trying to suck up but ur snipes are legendary and ur shots are on point,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Why tf you hogging ammo??,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,This was sorta a lesson.. lol J ask's Hutch throughout the whole battle that he needs some of the loot and Hutch picks it all up without sharing.. When Hutch asked for loot  J was the first one to say here are the spare rockets I have.. in the end  J was the last man standing.. and I bet he didn't have any ammo. Hutch  you played good  but in the end  you're the reason your team placed second. GOOD and BAD.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,[Insert comment about not sharing with teammates here even though they all did fine],Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,WTF?? why didn't they go to you. thats horse shit  you have no help,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I watched that quad kill about 10 times and each time it got funnier  shame about the ending.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,His own hubris was his demise. Dam hutch u greedy asf lol and austic screech...lol. enjoyed the content though was rooting for the loss  Good show.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Damn  that ending. Was hoping J would pull through!!! Nice fucking snipes tho!! Also  it takes like 5 seconds to drop some ammo  come on Hutch! Give your boy J some ammo!!,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,this was easily the best fortnite gameplay ive seen.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Poor hutch lmao gg man,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Disgusting. Greedy people like you are the reason america is in the shit right now. In this game you are supposed to share all your resources which is a metaphor for socialism; it's trying to TEACH YOU SOMETHING!!! That's why you don't see capitalist Bush flying his plane holograms into your fortnite towers like he did to the trade center  I am going to go volunteer at a North Korea labor camp because someone has to and I'm not a self centered piece of shit like you and I actually care about my fellow humans.  EDIT: Sorry about that  I'm just upset because my asshole brother just stomped my hamster flat and slid it under my door as part of the prank war we have going on. My point above still stands though,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,WHAT WERE THOSE SNIPES,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Be nice to J  hutch lol dudes a saint,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Fuck dude  I'm 7:26 in and you've landed some delicious snipes,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Fuuuuuuuuu...,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Not to beat a dead horse  but share your loot you Scrooge cunt,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Good video but not sharing with team isn't very helpful Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Ouch  that ending hurt worse than the last election's ending.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Timestamps: 0:37=1 0:56=2 and 3 2:08=4 and 5 5:30=6 and 7 6:23=8 (didnt add to the counter  only finishes off an already-downed player) 6:53=9 7:13=Nice shot (Yelling) 7:58=10 (downs  then gets kill after group is wiped) 10:33=11 11:15=12-13 (Yelling) 14:03=14-18 (Solo squad wipe) (Yelling) 17:20=Downed,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,too greedy,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,You and Seananners have gotta be the worst guys to play with. You both dont hesitate to hoard everything.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I dunno  some of those old Holy Crap It's Hutch gameplays were pretty ridiculous.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,It's sad if this is the "best" gameplay you've ever posted.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,The game is good EXCEPT for the bob the builder shit. I enjoy it up until someone's reaction when i shoot at them isn't to shoot back  but to build walls.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch is actually selfish as hell in this game  his buds are asking for medkits and he doesnt even mention that he has one while hes 100 hp... not to mention all the ammo he kept taking and not sharing...,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Wowza this is easily one of your greatest gameplays ever. Some of those shots were nutty,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I knew it was an L as soon as he went down the hill instead of building up in the zone smh great game tho,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Surprised you have friends acting like that,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I fucking love you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch: "Suck my dick" J: "Oh Yeahhhhhhh"     Not your best game  you didn't win,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Can't always play for the highlight reel amigo.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,17 kills don't mean anything. Unless you win it's pointless,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Goddamn these snipes... Hutch's sniping was on point. Fucking phenomenal.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Jesus dude share some ammo. Or weapons. Or anything. Wtf.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Amazing gameplay until that karma kicked in...,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,HUTCH is a dirty lootwhore,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch is a beast with the sniper,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch  this is where I offer you a cigarette and ask you a question...,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Would it kill you to not not share with your friends?,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I mean I like the video but is this dude always such a greedy bitch? Why even bother team up if you're going take everything? Like he has two hundred plus rounds but it's not enough so he takes more.  It doesn't even click that his friends may need some of that loot. It was annoying to watch. Also after his accumulation of loot he still asks for more. Why are the friends of you tubers such cucks  like any other person would say some shit if you did this all the time.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,You say this is your best gameplay ever...key word is YOUR. Would've been cool if this was a solo game  but you're just an ass to your team.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I remember watching this live. That ending was more powerful and emotional than the ending of Marley And Me.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Awesome game Hutch. Can't believe you didn't check your flank though.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Jesus i thought hutch was a liberal what a selfish cunt,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Bro his sniping holy crap,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,So much hope...,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,For all the people saying Hutch was a greedy bitch  yeah  he was. But you're all lying if you say you've never done that when you're riding the adrenaline from a kill streak  so fucking stop. He probably knows lol.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Share your ammo. Fuck.   I always want to watch you play but those rage/excitments are so cringy.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,14:37 omg fuck me daddy,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,loot goblin,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Holy shit Hutch you weren't kidding GG,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,came for the kill count   stayed for the vengeful karma,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,that rage q tho boys,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Great video  but you should share your resources with your teammates..,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,wtf youre a beast with the bolty,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,hutch got greedy as fuck  it was annoying to watch the ending is just karma,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Quality video! I think you have potential to be a HUGE YouTuber and make so much money that this becomes your permanent job! It's just We noticed that your channel isn't growing very fast  which is holding you back! I actually endured the same exact problem on my main channel until my friend hooked me up with his promotion service on Fiverr. He wanted to test his promotion strategies on my videos and WOW my main channel practically exploded after that. The dude advertised my video in front of millions of people and now I have thousands of views  subscribers  and comments because she brought the right traffic i needed for my particular channel and content. My spouse and i want you to grow and get the views that you deserve  so I'd suggest you look into a promotion service like his. The link to his service is in the bottom right corner of my channel banner. Please keep working on your channel! Success is right around the corner!!,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Got too greedy hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,anyone play this on console? I just picked it up and the aim assist is really weird to me. Also  semi related... I saw it at Target today for $60 and I'm sure that includes the PvE but holy hell,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,We have launch pads. Keep that in mind. And then the ending I was so hopping you'd remember.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,"SUCK MY DICK" "Oh Yeah... I mean nooo" Lol love it,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,SUCK MY DICK. ahahaa,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,iv been watching hutch on and off from back in the sark seananners days. i swear hes got more toxic with his friends. its like a lot of ppl on old men of optic are toxic and immature. always crying about kill stealing  loot taking. i just feel this tension between hutch  j   diesel and hecz. and i dont like it.,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,you are really good at sniping. but really bad at team work. it takes like 2 sec to drop some ammo for a friend....,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Ahhhhh that guy had 1% hp left,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Hutch you wrecking ball,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,What do you/people think of a Battlefield BR game? imagine the frostbite engine combined with BR,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,How many kills?,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,My name's Hutch and I make gaming sex videos and put them on the internet,Hutch,shaun0728

tYqpwL4qS6g,wanna be a bit more obnoxious orrrr,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,I love the fortnite videos  especially when its the entire match! Thanks for the entertainment,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Was not expecting that sickening ending,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,those were some amazing shots throughout  shame you didnt see all your granades were bouncing off the slope and did nothing against them :/ awesome game!,Hutch,shaun0728
tYqpwL4qS6g,Damn that ending was epic and I did not see that coming,Hutch,shaun0728

iChQPz9sBVc,I stayed in the room for my German Shepard when I was a young kid about 12 and hearing this made me cry and think about some happy memories thanks man,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My cat was killed by my dog. They were both friends from a young age up until the day my cat died. My dog just played a bit rougher than usual one day and hurt him. I should've kept them separate.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I wonder if it bothers you that stark has more followers and less videos that you.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Hey hutch can you do a reaction video of the Gay sex doesn't make you gay video did a long time ago?,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Hey man I'm really sorry for your loss. I've come to your videos happy and I've come while feeling like shit. The best way of dealing with the latter isn't always to avoid it but to go through it  so thank you for sharing. Its easy to envy a guy who plays video games for a living  but its really refreshing to have you share with us. Just keep making videos and putting 'em on the internet  we'll be here watching either way.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry about mojo (ur cat),Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Oh it's terrible. Had to do that Feb 6th 2016 to my dog. I'll never forget the date. That day was awful.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I've been stressing out with certain problems as of late and i found it comforting in a way  as I'm watching you intro this video  to know I'm not alone. Gotta stay focused and positive. These curveballs  obstacles  and other bullshit are nothing new and are always getting tossed our way from time to time in life. But we always bounce back from it  things just fall into place to help us get through whatever problems we face. Always.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I'm so sorry about your cat hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My cat died 2 weeks ago. He had a home before us and they were bad to him so we got him as a rescue cat. On his last day I sat with him all day as he died and groaned and I had to clap him as his body shut down and he died in front of me.....cats dying is tough man,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I went to the University of Oregon! Great school  wishing your niece the best of luck,Hutch,shaun0728

iChQPz9sBVc,Do not feel guilty hutch  you did right by your cat.  The love that you share is immortal.. I hope you feel better real soon.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry about your loss Hutch. I lost my 15 year old dog about a year ago so I know what you are going through. I was glad I got to be there when he passed  it was so peaceful that when I think back to it  it was the right decision. In the beginning it was for us but in the end it was for him so that's all that matter. I miss that noisy fucker and I don't think i'll ever stop. Hope you feel better soon!,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry to hear hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My fam just put down our dog last week  feeling the exact same feels man,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Hey man. Sorry for the loss of your cat.. We had to put my dog down just yesterday and we've had him for fifteen years. I know how it feels and felt this transparency was pretty timely.. Just sorta wanted to mention it.  It'll be all good in the end  when a pet gets sick and is struggling in life  sometimes it's kinder to do that kinda thing  but it still hurts.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Life just sucks sometimes...,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry for your loss homie.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Pet em guys. Pet em.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Oh..Mojo.. Been holding in a bunch of emotions today..the person I love just announced she's pregnant..with someone else's kid..but Mojo.. Sorry man..,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I'm sorry pal  it's tough but once they're suffering its not wrong to let them RIP. You made the right choice and hope you can get through it bud,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,So sorry for your loss. I completely understand your pain. Had to put my childhood dog down in 2015 and it was the most difficult thing I've ever gone through emotionally. However  don't let this stop you from adopting another animal. There are so many that need good homes.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,The music at the end ruined the video,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Ending song was pretty sweet.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Started watching your videos back in the modern warfare times. Only recently returned  glad to see you're still creating good content. Sorry for your loss Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Don't punish yourself over the decision. You did everything with love as the motivation. Take care.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I actually teared up when I realized what your title meant.. Sorry man  I wish you the best in your recovery.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I feel you hutch. 2 years ago i lost two cats in a couple of month. Similar story to yours -. - Either you understand it or not (the grief),Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Losing a pet is always like losing a family member. Sorry for your loss.  Reminded me of when Juicetra had to put his dog down  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neRB_A03_Qg Always gets me in tears.  I fear for the day when I am in the same situation with my dog.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I had to put down my Great Dane down a few months ago. I had her since she was born  and we found out she had leukemia. It was my first time being with a pet being put down as well. I watched her go and bawled my eyes out. I stood by my car with only her collar and just cried. Took me awhile to get over a loss of a friend but it gets easier  I promise.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,c,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,stay frosty,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My condolences for your loss.  I know how hard it is to lose a pet.  We had to put our cat down a few years back due to a similar cystic kidney disease. I wish you the best <3,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Feel your pain  Hutch.  Have a 9 yr old dog my wife and I got before getting married.  Found out earlier this year the growth on his ass is a cancerous tumor.  He seems OK  but I'm dreading the day I have to make the decision to put him down.  Hang in there  buddy.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Hey Hutch   We love you! Been watching your videos for years and you're such a damn cool dude! Keep your head up  but also know that it's ok to not be ok. Much love from Utah! :),Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I feel your pain Hutch...my Cat Leo Just Passed away from old age...his last few weeks..were not the best..he had a stroke which made him blind...also his balance went so he could barely walk...i feel like i was not a good friend to him...to just let him live in pain and suffer...but what can you do when you barely get by in life and do not have the money to put him down...but i do feel your pain hutch...and your videos cheer me up when i am feeling down...thank you...,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Losing your pets is tough.   My sincere condolences hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I was there a few months ago Hutch! Had to put my dog of 10 years down after finding out he had a tumor in his bladder. It was tough as hell but it'll get better!,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My honest condolences  I cant relate fully as I have never had a cat or a dog in my life yet  but I remember when I was like 6 or 7 when my first fish called Bobo died I lost it n took his lifeless body into my mum n dads room at like 6am crying my eyes out  quite funny looking back but was really upsetting at the time,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I am so sorry to hear that Hutch  I know what you are dealing with. <3 you,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Thoughts are with you Hutch. I know what it feels like. Rest easy knowing he had a good life with you.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,had to put my dog down a month ago  i know that feel :( it helps to think that they are in a better place now  at least for me. you just want them to be comfortable,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I lost my oldest dog 6 weeks ago and then my 2nd a week later we believe he gave up because the other one did. Losing pets is horrible. My condolences are with you hutch xx,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I lost my cat this past Summer. She was an old lady  but had some issues. She was also my first pet. Even at 22 years old  when she died It destroyed me. It still sucks to think about  but I did everything I could do  and she loved me. Sorry about your loss  Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Oh man Hutch i feel you. I've had cats all my life  hope you feel better soon.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,The loss of a pet is as profound as any loss that can effect you. I still think about pets that have been gone for over 20 years - they always stay with you. :(,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Thank you for being you. Sorry about your loss.. they are truly family members..,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,What was the song at the end?,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I feel you man  my dog was terminally ill and the doctors told us he would pass on in his own time  and painless. He took his last breath in my arms on my birthday :(,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Hey Hutch. A couple of months back I had to put my family dog down in the same week as a I lost a job I worked really hard for  it was the hardest week of my life. It really fucking sucks losing a part of your family  and don't feel strange about the way you're grieving  just let it happen. All the best man :),Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,<3,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry man. I know how this is :(,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I totally understand where your coming from  just had to have our cat of 13 years put down. she had stomach cancer and within 2 days there was nothing that could be done that wouldnt be super invasive and only extend a painful life.  as you said  it comes in waves. one moment totally fine  the next emotion welling inside you that you miss them and wont be able to hold them again or show affection like you did with them. just miss the little bugger  but ill always be glad to have shared time with her.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,My thoughts are with you man I've been there when 1 of my dogs had to be put down she had incredibly painful arthritis in her back legs to the point she could barely walk and her muscles had started to degrade it was what was best for her and tbh being there with her when she past was hard but it was the right thing as she knew she wasn't alone,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,death isnt the end amigo,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,That's one thing that people like SeaNanners have lost with their fans - the personal aspect. I get that it's only like a minute or two at the beginning of a video  but when has Adam or some of the others that have gotten that big  ever gotten down on a personal level like Hutch?  Thank you Hutch for being so open about these things. That's honestly why you're one of my favourite YT'ers. I hope when you reach the same levels as them that you behave the exact same as you do now :).,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Please post more fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Losing a pet hurts. We had to put my childhood dog down when I was 15  I didn't even know until I got back from school and my dad told me,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Cuck,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry to hear about your kitty my man! As a couple with 2 cats we hear ya! You done what you could.  Also  my kitty is also called mojo :),Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sending positive vibes your way man.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,you are a good man for staying in the room with your cat,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Let me just tell you I have a old yeller story myself and wow that shit was crazy.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry to hear about Mojo hutch. Pets are family  and its tough to deal with it.  We love ya hutch. Hang in there,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Ugh man as soon as you said what it was I welled up. Fucking love my cat to death  he is my fur son. Well done to you for being his owner/servant. You contributed to him having a great life and should be proud. RIP Mojo. x,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Had to put our dog down 6 months ago. Didnt have him long  but Sherlock was the sweetest boy with a troubled past  and after biting one too many people  I had to hand him off knowing he was gonna die. The doofy  happy look on his face broke me down. I feel for you Hutch  hang in there man!,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,That music at the end was pretty hype.  Sorry about your cat.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,First william osman's house burns down and now Hutch's cat dies. week full of feels,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,<3,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Pour one out for ole Mojo. Glad that gato brought you so much joy  he will be missed.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,What are your pc specs?,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,We love you bro. Stay strong !,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Go Ducks,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Very intense and enjoyable gameplay  Hutch. Hope you're holding up alright. Went through a similar thing with my dog a bit over a year ago so I can somewhat understand how you're feeling. I think it's always better when you are transparent with your viewers because the ones that really care and that stick around on your channel are here because we like you as a person  not just because of the escape. It makes it easier to build somewhat of a digital relationship with you and you're viewers  but that's up to you in the end.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,Sorry for your loss hutch. I feel for you. I've had to put multiple pets down in the past. Always sucks but now you know he can rest easy.,Hutch,shaun0728
iChQPz9sBVc,I feel ya  pal. My cat of 15 years just passed away this Spring. He may have had some sort of cancer and became sickly thin. He couldn't control his bowels any more and I chose to avoid putting him down  because I was telling myself he should go out on his own terms. I too felt guilty  but to make it pass I hope he understood what I wanted. Chin up  pal.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Justice league characters fortnite season 4,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,more movie reviews!,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews. I just want to have a full on spoiler full discussion of the Last Jedi  please Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,They've got that battlefield bullet travel and bullet drop vibe,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I watched most of the DC movies and sadly stopped expecting them to be good. Only good movies where Dark knight when Christian Bale played as batman. The next movie that was decent was Man of steel. Then there is Wonder Woman  the movie was just hype and was waste of 9 bucks watching it at theater. From now on I am just going to watch them on the web and save myself some bucks.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I'm ok with whatever commentary you want to give  but I'll say  I found myself not watching the first half of the video. Might be ok in a free roaming game like this  but  just an editing consideration. If you have particularly good gameplay I'd be careful of your commentary overriding it.  Could be a good thing if it's at a boring part.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I really disagree with your opinion on Justice league. The conflict between the directing styles made it confusing and tired  and the acting was inorganic and stale at best. There was no cost to anything that the characters did and the opening which should have been a no brainer made no sense. The moral of the story seemed to be that if you come together maybe superman will come and save your ass so don't worry (at least that's what I got out of it)  and I have seen better plots in porn. Also  batman only had two gadgets  which was really lame as apparently the focus of his superpowers were that he was rich  but we didn't see that. And all the other characters powers never interacted with each others so there was no team fighting organic. Overall it just felt like a bunch of video game cutscenes sewed together with no though or care.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Please do more movie reviews. I enjoy them. (even if I'm late to this video),Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,MOVIE REVIEWS,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Thank god  I've missed you talking about movies since you talked about eternal sunshine! Fucking great movie,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Cyborg's CGI was noticeably bad. It was actually the worst thing about the movie. How can you say it looked fine compared to everything else?,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,i dont see it. ezra miller was bad as the flash tbh,Hutch,shaun0728

b5buNtmVgE0,Adam DID NOT like this video.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Hey hutch  helpful tip for resourcing in FNBR: if you crouch and hit the corners of objects ( like the corner of a car bumper or a tree root) the critical circle can't move as much  so you can break things down much faster. Definitely helps a lot on consoles  may not matter as much on PC. Cheers  and thanks for the videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews please,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,this is some olddddddddddd footage,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews!!!!! Yes  sir.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I don't get why people hate on Ben Affleck as Batman  I thought he was the same character he was in Batman vs Superman. You're definitely right starboard shines in this movie and I can't wait for his solo film. Really wish they went with Wally West if Flash was going to be that funny. I knew I hated the Ezra Miller casting from the beginning.,Hutch,shaun0728

b5buNtmVgE0,moar reviews for sure. I just saw Thor Ragnarok and absolutely loved it one of the best superhero movies i've seen in a while,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews. I didn't know a lot about what the background of the movie's actors. That was really interesting. Honestly I wish this entire video was you talking about JL,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More reviews. And go see Lady Bird,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Why the heck was superman CGI!! It also felt like the whole film was a bad cinematic for a world of Warcraft release...,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I'd be really interested in more movie reviews  but just go a little more in depth besides  "his character was good  this scene was cool  this part could've been better." But hey  I know you aren't a movie reviewing channel,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Definitely want more movie reviews.,Hutch,shaun0728

b5buNtmVgE0,Wish it was the OG justice league with manhunter and hawk girl instead of cyborg. I like him better as a teen titan with that blue tech outfit instead of the red one,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I clicked on this video so fast thinking I saw rocket league in the title.... Am sad now,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Definitely more reviews! I love any video where you do commentary.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Can't wait for Deadpool 2!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I'd love to hear your thoughts on Lego Batman Hutch. I'm still blown away that a Lego movie is better than all of the DECU films.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Can't wait to torrent the inevitible R-rated version that they'll claim to be better.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,As long as you add spoiler or review to the title.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,The movie was very ok but as you said it feels a bit choppy and very straight forward. I felt like something was missing from the middle. The positive for the movie and the wider DCEU is I think the actors do a good job and better material would breed better results. The problem with the movie and the wider DCEU is lack of proper oversight. This is where the MCU is completely superior.  The MCU movie  some better than other  allowed their directors to show some personal flair while making me believe all the movies exist in the same universe. Zack Snyder's is way too overpowering  though I guess the universe was meant to be based around his movies but i'm just not a fan of his aesthetic. The color palette and action scenes seem off  like it's not real. I obviously know it's not real but i'm supposed to be immersed.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Yeah I like the reviews but maybe just do them as there own videos,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I love your videos that have long intro commentary and then the game finishes and we can listen to that.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Can we get a cooking with hutch soon? You should cook that breakfast you keep mentioning on stream.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,more reviews more reviews more reviews,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,After Suicide Squad  I will never trust DC to produce a good superhero movie again,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Yes I love movie reviews  you should talk about Thor!! I thought that movie was absolutely hilarious,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Good God this game is unappealing to look at,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I didn't even watch the gameplay  I just came here because I just saw the movie and wanted to hear what you had to say about it. I'm not on the train for Fortnite.  I'm kind of easy when it comes to movies  I enjoyed it... but it wasn't the best. I'm having a hard time placing how I feel about it. I think overall I liked it  like a 7 or 7.5 and I feel like the next one would be a lot better  but who knows. I've been saying that for a bit now.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Full Blade Runner Review?,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,It's funny that Wonderwoman had one of the best and most interesting villains in any recent superhero movie  but had the most bland  one-dimensional protagonist in recent memory,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Always enjoyed listening to you talk about films over the years. If it could be a weekly thing that would be awesome :),Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Also- definitely down for more movie reviews,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Saw it tonight. Can confirm aquaman was a dude bro.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,YES MORE MOVIE REVIEWS,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Hutch I love your movie reviews!  You should get a Moviepass so you can see all the new movies for free and give us more reviews. :),Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I've seen the movie i agree with most of what you have to say  however I want to enjoy your opinion  and while your "review" was not full of spoilers it could use a little more tact or a nice potential  spoiler warning at the start my friend.  Keep the vids coming and I'll keep watching like the fanboy that I am,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,more movie reviews :),Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,I love the movie Reviews hutch. maybe like one a month or so  nothing super in depth  but ya know a couple of minutes. We'd appreciate it,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,For sure more movie reviews. They don't need to be recent movies either. Would love to see like a Hutch's favourite movies or underrated movies series.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Please  people. Boycott the movie because of the choice of Danny Elfman.  Everyone musically inclined I've talked to says his score DOES NOT WORK and I've heard it on Youtube. He literally uses the 1989 Batman  the old Superman and the 2003 Hulk theme.  He is a fucking hack piece of shit  and they should not have fired Junkie XL.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Optic CrItIc  I love it  keep it up hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Weekly movie reviews with Hutch? Sounds good to me!,Hutch,shaun0728

b5buNtmVgE0,More movie reviews. Really wish there you did one for Blade Runner 2049 :/,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,MOAR REVIEWS,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,The lip CGI wasnt even that terrible  you were probably looking for it which made it bad.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Would like to hear more thoughts on Blade Runner,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Talking like Justice League is just a middle of the road film 5/10 is just wrong. JL is not an all time great film by any means but it wasn't an average film. Don't get this "disjointed" criticism in regards to the story either.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,you should do the new Thor movie review,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,11:15 I gotta half chub when I thought that shot was gonna land,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Wtf are you  rotten tomatoes? Stick to gaming,Hutch,shaun0728

b5buNtmVgE0,I would love to see some more movie reviews on here,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Tbh i love when you are just talking. Like i would love if you just talked over your whole video. Also if you debated ben shapiro  i feel like that would be a great debate!,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,This gameplay has already been posted i remember the last 5 minutes of this on another video.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,Yas more movie reviews pls.,Hutch,shaun0728
b5buNtmVgE0,YAS! More movie reviews Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,What's the ending song?,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,That was pretty tame with Hecx  there definitely has been worse.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,You said that it got a bit heated. I've heard like 10x worse with OMoO xD.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Editing in a Fortnite video? I can't believe my eyes,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,The usual problem when anyone fights with Hutch during Fortnite is usually he is bossing everyone around and yet Hutchy is always the one running away doing things on his own from the team lol,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,hey are axes colors purely cosmetic or do you collect more resources or faster,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Nice to see Hector and Nick getting better at the game :D You make a good squad dude!! Dont invite Mboze tho hahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I'm stuck on console but even there this game is growing on me.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I don't get how people don't love the new scoped AR and just how perfect every single shot it. That battle you had on the roof in the farm would have been over so much quicker. Damage reduction doesn't matter so much when you're shooting a gun that you're not hitting only 1 out of every 4 shots.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,your aim is disgusting,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,need friends on PC pls add me Shortdood,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,You are so mean to Hector.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Was waiting for an instense argument all game. Did I accidentally skip it or something? Lol,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,#releasethememo,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Cmon hutch you gotta upload the full vid man,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I enjoy the shorter videos for sure. Although I would like to see all kills and to see how you acquired your loot... makes the video interesting,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Heyooo  are you planning on posting sea of thieves Hutch? Loving the Fortnite on twitch  keep it up!! Thanks Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Gotta post the entire gameplays man,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Need to unwind from playing Fortnite by watching you play Fortnite lol,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,"Don't give Hutch a jump pad!"  Hutch wins with jump pad.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,You will get to 1 million,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Hutchniac,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Solid video!,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,What is this hello friendos bizness,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I think by far the coolest thing I've done in fortnite was chuck a nade at this guy rushing me. He was pretty far away I aimed up so high and threw it and it landed right In front of him killing him I didn't know the first one hit so I threw the rest and stood there waiting but he was already dead lol,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Still "PALS" right Hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I love the fortnite vids sir Hutch! But i have asked many times and I will ask again... Can we have gay sex doesnt make you gay tshirts again  pleeeaaaase?,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Humble is hutch  keep it real man and keep it up!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,great stuff hutch. keep up the good work. for some reason i like your fortnite gameplay more than your cod stuff...maybe its because im trash at cod and have just wonderful (awful) memories (nightmares) about cod. sincerely  some random asshole on the internet.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,*Cough* OMoO WWII comeback? *cough*,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,I love the videos and you know im a constant in the streams! One thing i would like to say is i like the longer version instead of cutting it,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Loving the Content. I mean seriously  this is Good.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,hecz ruins your stream.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,UGH  servers have been down forevvvveeer. I'm in game just waiting for 30 players to connect. LOL :D  I uttery loathe the fact that the launcher tells you can't lauch the game... If that's the case  just start from the .exe.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Hutch what hapened with cod? No cod videos at all  thats sad.,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Keep it up! I think your sleeve looks cool too,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Fortnite is down how u do this,Hutch,shaun0728
WFtuxH8WrIs,Meow,Hutch,shaun0728

ct3OwOTyZ5o,I love you hutch   that is all...,Hutch,shaun0728
ct3OwOTyZ5o,Absolutely can see why you hit a barrier with COD  it is because it doesn't reward aggressive and impulsive gameplay as much as with this game  which seems to suit you well sir ;),Hutch,shaun0728
ct3OwOTyZ5o,"Grab a beer and enjoy the video"... Proceeds to crack open a Great Northern. Keep up the awesome videos Hutch  i'm enjoying Fortnite so much aswell and feel i'm improving everyday <3,Hutch,shaun0728

ct3OwOTyZ5o,Honestly I was terrible before j watched hutch play  then I mimicked a few things he was doing and I'm winning at least a couple of solos every day. It really is nice not to suck.,Hutch,shaun0728
ct3OwOTyZ5o,fwiz on ur vids is fucking gold,Hutch,shaun0728

AsQsX1uYFV8,I don't pay top down strat games  but they could do some really cool shit with the avatars in the multiplayer aspect of this game if the idea takes off... imagine being able to like float by your opponent as they're doin their own shit on their side of the map,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,I hear "lead designer of Age of Empires 2" and i was sold,Hutch,shaun0728

AsQsX1uYFV8,Nice to see some sketches from you two  Hutch! Quick tip  the shots in the beginning broke the 180 degree rule in film - both people are looking in the same direction off-screen which sometimes makes it confusing who's looking at whom (it's obvious in this case though). That and Esme's shot was a little crooked...but yeah keep making these types of vids to get more practice!,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,Does nobody else see how fake and money hungry Hutch has become?,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL,Hutch,shaun0728

AsQsX1uYFV8,I thought "The Awkward Genie" was a new opener you were going to teach my at first,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,Wouldn't your neck hurt from looking down for such a long period of time? Especially with the weight of a VR headset on your head.,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,You just reminded of the old respawn days where you Adam and Sark and Hollywood would screw around with stupid skits  you're so good at making them funny  I'd love to see you do more.,Hutch,shaun0728

AsQsX1uYFV8,Yep it landed,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,You really have to quit with the background music. It seems like that's often a problem in your videos. Or it's to loud or it doesn't fit the video. I'm not trying to be negative. I've been a fan for a long time! Love you hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,no bloopers?,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,I'll be honest. From the title  I thought this was the first in a series of mini-chess tutorials that he was going to call "Brass Tactics" (As in  "Let's get down to brass tax(tics)")  and his first lesson was going to be about an opening called the Awkward Genie.  Damn do I miss those chess videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,The intro was weird but it made me feel nice  9/10,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,those horrorfilmworthy dead eyes.. nightmare fuel,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,only you can make a promoted video so much fun :D,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,I like these type of videos Hutch. Here is some feedback for you. Follow the 180 rule and make sure you have matching eye lines with your actors. Besides that it looks good.,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,Hutch is the next Denzel confirmed,Hutch,shaun0728
AsQsX1uYFV8,Intro was So corny it was amazing!,Hutch,shaun0728

q7o7mcLMzfc,You ever think of trying fantasy football?,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,someone is afraid and affected personally  idrk just saying,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Enjoyed the rant hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Just get to the point  bash Trump already  we get it. All this underlying bullshit just to try and jam your views into it to get people to vote differently in your favor and opinion. Trump won  its almost 2018  get the fuck over it  man up. Quit crying like a bitch. This undying support you have for a criminal (Hillary) is absolutely fucking disgusting behavior from a grown ass man. I mean you literally cried in that one video cause she didnt win. How anyone takes you seriously after that is astonishing. You must have some kind of psychological ability to manipulate people to think the way you do  cause I have no clue as to why you continue to try to jam your opinions down your subscribers throats even though its met with backlash almost every fucking time. Just shut the fuck up and play the game  we didnt subscribe to hear you bitch and moan about how UNCHANGED your life is because the person you wanted to win didnt win.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,What headset is Hutch wearing?,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hey Hutch did you know you can put Wax  the thc concentrate  on the coils of your vape?! i just tested it for you,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Wth hutch leave politics out of video games  your opinion is exactly that  and all your doing is what teachers do which is spread their political agenda because their in a influential position with a large audience. I could easily preach on how democrats have upheld any progress in passing laws when they had the majority in congress and how they've now changed there position on passing anything that trump wants passed. My political opinion is the polar opposite of yours  it's not any more valid than yours because it is only that... an opinion. So play video games and stop preaching your issue with the division in this country when your causing more of it.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,commie faggot,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,In other words  net neutrality is gone. So all YouTubers are gone and those who rely on gaming or some sort of web income.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Yo hutch on one of your last streams you were talking about how trump wouldnt condemn the white nationalists and ive been thinking about it. In alot of peoples minds he didnt condemn them by saying there was violence on both sides. The antifa are a part of the extreme left that focus on violence against people with different opinions or "punching nazis"  the only difference between either sides is the politics they are fighting over  and they have violence in common. "There was violence on both sides" is a statement that condemns both sides  but it pissed off people who are on antifas side because he didnt condemn the nazis more than he did antifa. Does it really matter which opinion youre attacking people over? If antifa killed millions to make a progressive utopia or if hitler did it for race purity the reason for either doesnt matter its your actions that matter. Infact hitler thought he was doing good just like antifa does.   Just food for thought love ya man hit me back up,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,This game sucks.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Its a two year seat which was won in a narrow margin to a alleged attempted child molester. Alabama is not going to turn blue.   Also  there are multiple news interviews with Doug Jones supporters where they are discussing frankly how they voted multiple times  or cast votes even though they reside out of state.  Say what you want but the only people organizing out of state field trips to place illegal votes are Democrats. The desperation is honestly pathetic.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hutch  I love your content and truly enjoy watching your gameplays  but I hate having to skip through half your video because you talk over it about something else. As a consumer  I purely watch your content for the content  nothing else. You're a great guy and if you do a vlog video I'll usually peruse it  but when it's a gameplay video about Fortnite or OMOO I want to watch you play the game and your in-game reaction. I'm sure you don't care   but I wanted you to know that it's how I feel and you deserve proper feedback and constructive criticism. I love you :),Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Ben Shapiro 2020,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I think that people don't realize that this isn't as much a political talk as it is a life talk.  All people who are here to "not listen to politics and watch gaming videos" are in denial of what they need to hear.  Even if you disagree with hutch  it is important to be informed of multiple sides of topics.  Keep up the great content @Hutch !!,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,More of this man ..,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,maybe its just because trumps viewpoints are so far out of wack and to the right... but i find it difficult to respect someone who supports this particular republican president,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,HUTCH is just too much. so pro.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Ask if you can be a guest on PKA,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I just wish America didnt make it so complicated so it was easier for the rest of the world ( or at least me ) to understand whats going on over there.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I fucks w the rant,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Thanks for the knowledge bro,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Jesus please put a politics warning or something so I don't have to watch these.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,8 years dem  8 years repub. trust the process,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I encourage rants from time to time. I just like it when creators are themselves and do what they want. Always the best content when the creators themselves enjoy it.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I really liked the talk at the first half of this video. It made me realize that I have been standing at the top of a slippery slope of ultimately demonizing the people on the opposite wing  and that's the last thing the world needs right now. We're all human  and we need to unite to do something about this mess.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Such a great message  man. My best friend and I have entirely different political opinions on almost everything.. Lots of respect  Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Democrats won in Alabama because they launched a full media smear campaign against Roy Moore. All you have to do right now is accuse somebody of sexual assault and your reputation is smeared for good. Democrats realize they aren't going to win any seats based on their message  because they don't have one other than "STOP TRUMP". Ted Cruz is the next republican up for re-election soon in Texas  mark my words the media will all the sudden start accusing him of being a sexual predator next. It's probably the nastiest time in politics right now.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Great video  man. You and H2O Delirious should collab on fortnite. He's in love with it as much as you are  and you'd be a power team like none other.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Someone once told me if you are in your 20's and not liberal you don't have a heart. and if you are in your late 30's and aren't conservative you don't have a brain. GL,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,entirely off topic to this vid  but I used to watch hutch like 8 fucken years ago when he used to play MW2 and shit  during the "Hutchisyodaddy" and machinima days. Didn't even know he was still making vids till youtube recommended me. I'm impressed you're still kicking along bro  much love from an old fan.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Not sure how you can say it's the most interesting political climate right after you admit that you've never paid attention to politics before. I do agree that most countries work like pendulums though  and that's why I expect a couple more Republican presidential terms before the Democrats are able to elect a leader. I think you're greatly mistaken as to why the Democrats have lost their foothold in the houses; it has more to do with their social agenda (what they consider political correctness) than their fiscal policy.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,What it really boils down to is that you can use your platform to spread your thoughts and people can agree or disagree with that approach. Personally I do not mind. I don't just watch your channel for gameplay. Your thoughts are part of it too.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Just spent 10 minutes bragging to my girlfriend about my favorite YouTuber since I was a teenager. We do have different political views  but that doesn't stop me at all from enjoying every video  Hutch. Thanks for the Content :),Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,We love the rants,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Something like a politics podcast or separate videos for politics talk would be a good idea. I know a lot of people enjoy your discussions about politics  myself included most of the times  even though since I live in Austria and we are currently dealing with a vastly excessive right wing shift  I honestly don't really care about a rant about U.S. politics on your channel... There seems to be a big part of your community who comes to relax and free their heads from worries and its not so great to see a video with the title "WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE" and instantly hear a political rant. Maybe you could take it into consideration in the future...,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Alabama elected a demand because the alternative was an accused child rapist.  Democrats will pick up some seats  but the Republicans won't lose their majority because they don't have enough vulnerable seats for that.  Interesting times for sure though.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Love fortnite  it would be sweet if they announced a new map,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I'm so glad I didn't get into football in particular as a kid. The amount of brain damage they sustain is incredibly massive,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Tip: Get your pickaxe out when picking up bandages and you won't go over 15 and trade your weapon.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Shut the FUCK up Tai "the bookcase lover" Lopez,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,usually I hate when you talk about politics  mainly because our views are different. I understand that people have different views and can express that  thats what makes america awesome  but that doesn't mean I want to watch a youtube video where those opposing views are the topic. this was a very nonpartial video and was very interesting. enjoyed it.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I'm still salty that you blocked me on twitter a year ago because I said something about Hillary on your tweet. Please unblock me lol...,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hutch i'd love to know your opinion on the gun laws in the US atm  as in my opinion i think some restrictions should be applied to obtaining a gun and ammunition due to the shootings which have happened. Also much love from the UK bro  keep doing what your doing.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,tbh i think one of the most unhealthy and damaging aspects of politics is the idea its like a spectator sport or something to be interested in. it leads to things like the understanding people dislike the Republicans simply because they're the other team or whatever. its an incredibly damaging narative which i think turns most people off engaging in politics as it completely ignores how people's lives are materially bettered or worsened depending on whos in power. its not a game. its not interesting. politics is a life or death. literally. If journalists spent time actually presenting politics about how certain policies will kill people or materially be worse off/in poverty - i.e. genuinely representing  peoples' interests - more people would be engaged. Making it into a race or a game is a massive diservice to the people who suffer as a result of politics and further disengages people from something already pretty monotinous and anal.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Just to touch on your sports piece at the beginning hutch... have a look at a video titled "ultras our way of life" .. its based on european ultras (hard core supporters/fanatics) supporting their team in football mainly (soccer to you) ..but also basketball handball or any other sport...be interesting to hear you opinions on this.. ultras are super fanatical and sometimes even die at the hands of other ultras or police supporting their teams.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Money  money is the reason why there's drama in sports,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,PLAY CHESS AGAIN,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,love and appreciate stuff like this brother. keep it up.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I love the political discussions. There should be no place where people can hide from it. And you're right it is the most interesting it's been in a while. With that said  what are your thoughts on 3rd parties and independents?,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Why does Hutch consistently either forget about  or omit  the New Jersey gubernatorial election this year?  It was the same day as the Virginia election  and just as big as Virginia's in my opinion.  Defeating Guadagno was akin to saying no to Trump and Chris Christie both  and a huge push towards the left for the state of New Jersey.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hutch I have to agree. Which is funny considering I'm Canadian. America is like a giant fishbowl right now. Some strange stuff going on down there.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Seems a little hyperbolic to say this is the most interesting time in U.S. History. I would say the Civil War or Revolutionary War times were undoubtedly the most important times we will ever have as a nation. I agree that the political climate today is a strange one but do not oversell the need to talk about politics. In some families  it is very difficult to bring that discussion up. Many people are very sensitive towards these topics and it is more important to feel the love of your family that to cause an argument  especially during the holidays.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Sean Idk if you really understand the full picture of what's going on. Democrats are not going to "sweep" elections.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I personally don't like the politics talk. I don't come to watch video games to hear about politics. I watch things like this to escape reality hutchy,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Love it when you rant,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I kinda agree  but I always ask myself a question - what is the point of knowing something  if you're not planning to use that knowledge? If it's just interesting to you - no problem. But like the sports example  if it's not interesting to me and I don't plan to have a career in sports - whats the point of spending time on it?,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,A fumbled match can still light a fire.  Democrats winning in Alabama I think is less a symptom of people fed up with Republican legislature and more that he was a pedophile. It still may have a cascading effect though.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I usually only say this when hutch brings up politics. If you are dissatisfied with the current political climate  regardless of which way it leans  get involved in your local politics  state  county  city level. They impact you far more on a day to day basis  and you actually do have a voice on this small a scale,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hutch is bae,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,listen to Chapo Trap House,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Competitive sports are a very important part of society  especially to children and teenagers. Teaching kids how to win or except loss is crucial in their development.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hutch i dont know if you listen to podcast but if you do you should check out "More Perfect" its about famous supreme court cases and the stories behind them  its made by the people that make RadioLab,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Plz stop ranting,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I WILL GO TO VALHALLA SHINEY AND CHROME!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,really liked the sports and politics connection,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hey Hutch  great rant  and I wholeheartedly agree! I'd also encourage younger voters to do their own research and not get pulled in by soundbytes on either side of the aisle.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,My opinion: politicians should be so limited in power it almost wouldn't matter (on a personal level) who's in charge.  Not an American though,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,I wont say its not impressive democrats won in Alabama. I would say tho that republicans didnt have a great candidate and didnt help a month before an election woman wanted  to report sexual assault from 40 years ago but even without that pass election he won he only won by 2% so hes just a bad candidate. Hope republicans rebound.,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Hey Hutch... Can we have gay sex doesnt make you gay shirts again? I know its a bit of an old phrase  but that doesnt make it any less relevant!,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,We need a new Hutch podcast man,Hutch,shaun0728
q7o7mcLMzfc,Well said  and could not agree more. Thank you,Hutch,shaun0728

dGY0qtCbMoM,"Who da fook is this guy" deserves a like,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Hutch  I know they're not the trend on Youtube now and maybe have gone out of fashion  but I've been a fan since the COD4 days and I would love it if you did the occasional throwback commentary  sort of 2011/2012 CoD commentary style just talking about whatever you want to.   I think it would be a hit with some of your long term subs :),Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,So addicted. Winning Fortnite games feels as good as my first few MW2 nukes.,Hutch,shaun0728

dGY0qtCbMoM,This game is terrible and boring.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I think most people like this game because you bring your own camping equipment. The game is fun  and in a lot off respects it's what pubg should have been but this game is a camping paradise.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I love the art style  it reminds me of Battlefield Heroes.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Hugh you need to practice quick building and editing as your wasting so many resources that aren't needed making stairs out of metal or brick,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,You played Diablo 3 in 1998?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I tried it and enjoyed it for the most part on xbox one btw. The building mechanic takes some getting used to. I wish it was gun on gun but I could get used to it. Also wanna try pubg and see if console version stands up to pc. Probably won't if I'm honest,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Wonder why he didn't just shoot down the house at 8:20,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,It's awesome to hear you're having so much fun with this game - great content too !,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I started playing Fortnite solo like at the start of October. I've sunk 100+ hours (which is a lot for me!) and I cannot get enough. So  fucking  addicted. Best game I've played in 7 years. (I loved early League of Legends..),Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I will always prefer pubg over fortnite. I can't play a BR game where you can build your own forts out of thin air just doesnt make sense to me. it takes a lot of the skill out of the game when it comes to learning the map and positioning well in a game. instead none of that matters in this game when you can just build walls and forts and make your own advantage. Pubg will always rule over the game because of that for me.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,fuck cod  more fortnite! Love this game  and ive never even played it,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I love fortnite but Im not a big fan on the console version  but i love the pc version,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,My friends and I were playing in a Fortnight game a few hours ago while you were streaming   we were among the last 15 people alive and you killed my friend and I on a hill. Phil_Nye and Carl_Hunchkins,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Huge fan of Fortnite. Being a console player this is my first experience with a battle royale game but I'm thoroughly enjoying it.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Alternative Game Title: Bob-The-Builder-Warriors xD,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,When you pass a gold scar...,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,every snipe you hit is super satisfying to watch,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Hutch! New to you and your channel  I think my first vid was an omoo vid with pamaj and from there I've watched a lot of your videos. Just firstly wanted to give you praise  you're content is flat out more entertaining than most streamers and your intros and commentaries are awesome. Also wanted to ask you if you would consider doing a fort nite tip video because Ive wanted get into it but I can never break the top 30.   P.s. Just my opinion but out of all the omoo you're definitely the coolest and funniest.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Downloaded it  played a few games and lasted less than a minute total... I think if I put some time in I'll figure it out.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,is his hutch from youtube?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Ooooh shit son that 1 million gettin close,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,watched you since mw2 love your on this game,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Just walked past that scar didn't he,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I had a Sega Master System as a Kids to! I had like  6 light gun games for it. Wish I still had it...,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,The thing about fortnite is that  it's really the only game that isn't a AAA title that I found out on YouTube  that I can actually play on console. Many or nearly all YouTuber gamers play on pc and I have never owned one to play the games I've enjoyed seeing them play. Fortnite is that special exception that is on all platforms.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I wish the game ran that smooth on PS4 on PC it looks like it runs flawless,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Is the aim assist off on PC. Screws me over on xbox,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,keep up the fortnite!,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,1:18 that gold scar doh,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Hey Hutch  get a room!,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Play fortnite with BigT  grow your audiences on the game you love?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Oh wow you played Diablo 3 back in 1998? A whole 14 years before it came out for the rest of the world.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Long intros before a live comm is the best of both worlds.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,The art style reminds me of Worms.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,the man wins two games back to back and people still complain about the way he plays...,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,totally agree id rather play fortnight than CoD right now,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,fortnite is just a really good game and its fucking free,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,me and my creew...FEEL THE SAME ive been really hyped for cod...But this game has still takin more of my time and the fact its free AND on console makes it all the better and im glad they have been adding stuff every week now..shit next week they are adding a silenced sub....im just glad everyone who talks about it enjoys it,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Not sure if I should like for the good commentary  or dislike for the legendary scar he missed a minute in.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Feel the same way about this game  man. Been incredible  and all I want to do is keep playing it. I got started in COD4 days as well  and I've been watching since you were in OpTic. Glad to see old school gamers still share the same taste. Keep up the grinding man  the game is well worth it.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Diablo 3 in 1998????,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I've followed Hutch since 2008 and I'm so glad to see he's endorsing this game that I've had so much fun on.   It's a rare gem for gamers at the moment in the vast swathe of money-grabbing-loot-box-throwing-titles. Fortnite BR is so refreshing.  Love from the UK!,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,rofll did you realize that you were running up on your own structure at 12:05?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Been playing a lot more chess recently and wondering if you've kept up with your chess. Always loved the chess vids (as I do all your videos)  keep on keeping on  man,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Completely agree with you hutch this game has taken over me and all my mates lives no other game matters at the moment lol,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Keep the Fortnite coming yo  solo's or squads WE DON'T CARE. it's good shit Sir Hutchington.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,would you ever play fornite in a competitive settings like gbs if it ever becomes a thing? that would be sick to watch,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I like the game  however the sensitivity options (and at times aim assist) on console are HORRIBLE.  Also a private 'training ground' or something like that would also be nice just so I can memorise the controls and button combinations  since quick decision making is key in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Why  no webcam though?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Enjoying seeing you played fortnight hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,legend,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Loved the video,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,"purely cosmetic" for Micro transaction is an excuse! ( i used to see it as hutch atm but it changed now ) since it also promotes the gambling gamedesign other studios like DICE/EA/DISNEY are using.. loot boxes are gambling and destroy good game design.. but who cares as long as the CEO shareholders make a huge profit in the market.. right?,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Honestly dude you're doing very well with the balance. It's awesome to see you stream this game. I actually like this more than COD. Enjoy your day meng.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Comments more worried about the gold scar  while i'm wondering why he continues building mega bases outside the circle lol. Btw love the CoD and fortnite,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Imagine when/if Blizzard makes their own BR. The thing that really keeps pubg from being something special is it lacks polish,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,7+ minutes of intro? I love it Hutch  hope you're having a great day,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Great! Now i  wanna go play fortnite again.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I started off on N64 as well. Always hated having to blow into the cartridges to clear out dust. I also played a lot of starcraft 1 online. Became one of the top 10 most feared players in custom games.,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,Just casually leaving a legendary scar behind at 1:18 like it's nothing,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,I too played Diablo 3 on battle net in 1998,Hutch,shaun0728
dGY0qtCbMoM,1:18 wow look in the hut,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,nice crooked shirt hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Grease Gun for the win,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,My K/D is basically ruined because I get bored of just using the BAR and the PPSh.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,"It's a 3 shot kill"  Takes 4 shots to the back to down the enemy at 4:11  ??,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Can you make a lmg video  they are useless to me and I'd like to see a way to use them,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,That intro right there reminded my why I subscribed so many years ago,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,J15 is a socialist,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hutch. I need a "gay sex doesnt make you gay" shirt. I couldnt buy it back in the day  and now im about pathetic enough to throw money at you!,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,M1941 assault rifle. Super underrated and kills very quickly,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,camper,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Grease gun reminds me a little of the UMP from mw2.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,4:50 "We just unleashed fury" (him and teammate get blown up) LuL PogChamp,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Seems like no one gives the LMGs love but the Lewis a beast and the MG42 is pretty solid as well.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Did this guy used to be good?,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Takes me at least 4-5 shots with this gun  same with every other fuckin gun,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,try out the Bren! 2 shot kill,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I used the type 100 a lot until I got the Brandi variant on the grease gun and I fell in love with it,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,The grease gun has NO RECOIL AND LOSTEN  im convinced that the standard version of the gun is bugged. Its scope visually kicks more than it actually does making it seem inaccurate. When I unlocked the candy variant i was shredding because if felt like there was no recoil,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,The grease gun is SHIT,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,DTreats' callouts are sooo good and accurate. Can Diesel not be the first dead every 15 seconds into the round? Lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hutch always seems to be playing on the Axis side.  Hutch alt-right confirmed?! :O,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,My fandom is past it's peak. I found that I haven't clicked any one of your vids in a while. Not really a fan of COD or BR games  kinda a fan of the streams tho  peace.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Can we get new t shirts,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Yeah grease gun is like an assault rifle smg hybrid. Like it better than the type 100; the former just kills so fast at the cost of a bit of recoil,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Oh shit its doggietreats!  Use to watch his sniping gameplays back in mw2.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hey guys I just got ww2 today and trying to decide which division to go. I saw that the sniper one has a special perk for silent footsteps  but there's also a basic perk for that as well. Are either of them better? Or are they the same and stackable to be completely silent? Thanks,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,The Waffe melts anybody at close range. It is a beast. It is not that great at ranged encounters though. But i am doing work with it. I am loving it right now.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,hutch... i love ya bro.. but if you use that grease gun against anyone decent your gonna get mollywopped.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Use STG44 with Infantry and Primed  and then for your attachments use Reflex Site  Grip  Rapid Fire  and Bandolier. Absolutely melts people and pretty much no one uses it. Very underrated.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,This game would be really good if they fixed things that need addressing. Make TDM 100 like in the Beta Make dom 100 points per kill. Shit even 75 is fine I don't understand why in S&D it's 100 per kill. If I want 100 per kill I'll go play TDM. Make it 500 like in MW Reduce the sound of footsteps Reduce flinch. That's a given. I just play hardcore now.  Fix hit detection. Cant tell how many times i've put 2-3 shots in someone and nothing registers. Obviously bring us new maps instead of the USS Headglitch and Derail 2.0 Some party games would be nice. I see Gun Game is on the way so that's good. Reduce the health regen time. It's absurd. Takes almost 10 seconds.  Either buff the killstreaks or add in new ones. 12-14 kills for Paratrooper Squad and they get me like 6 kills max. Which I think they also nerfed so prob even less now. Still want to see Dogs in here as a streak.   Do all this and I think we have a pretty solid game.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Song in the intro?,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Damn hutch is getting old,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I really like the waffa 28 with grip and advanced rifling. I also like the m1941 with extended mags grip and advanced rifling/rapid fire (could interchange thoses two),Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Proper video  perfect set up with the grease gun. Always good quality content from hutch. I commend this,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,It looks like a sniper to me w iron sights every time you start to aim,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Cool shoutout to Nadeshot. Even though I'm not a fan of his  I think it's cool that you're not afraid of another youtuber getting a referral  like a lot of people are.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Watch the killcam @ 4:21 and you'll see that it's a 4 shot kill. Advanced rifling doesn't extend the 3 shot kill range of the grease gun  only the 4 shot kill range. Also  grip and rapid fire barely reduce recoil and increase fire rate respectively to the point that they are both basically useless. It's all a placebo  switch up those attachments for something more useful. Info taken from 2 break down youtube channels  drift0r and xclusive ace. Keep the videos coming hutch :),Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Grease gun is great but it is definitely not an mini ACR. With the candy variant you have though it feels much more accurate.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,i Honestly enjoy the First assault riffle,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,gotta use the waffe 28. it's recoil has a bit of a learning curve but once you get it down the gun melts,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,No recoil? You high?,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I feel like the grease gun is more like a man-o-war version of an smg. Doesn't shoot fast enough to be compared to the acr,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Lewis with grip  extended mag  rapid fire and Lookout for basic. Infantry division,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Waffe Airborne silenced with grip and extended mags is pretty broken at close range,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hey hutch have you tried out the BREN since the new up date  its a 2 shot kill from the chest up from a ridiculous distance,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I think the OMOO solution is to NOT have all 4 of you guys on a team LOOOL DTreats mellows the rest of you 3 so much its incredible hahahaha #LessToxic,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hey Hutch  have you thought about uploading some close games that you guys don't end up winning? The games you've uploaded recently are pretty intense but some of that feeling is lost knowing that in the end your team always wins.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,You gotta get a game going with Juju Smith Schuster !!!,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I lose interest in the video when the commentary stops; these videos just feel lazy and uninspired. I love your commentaries  you should definitely extend them to 5 or so minutes.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,The PPSH is still my go to SMG. Probably the most used and most versatile SMG in the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I'd like to see you go back and use the M1 Garand more  one of my favorite rifles in all of history,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hated the grease gun at first now it's prolly my favorite.. in beta the waffle was my favorite but hated in beginning of game now using it more often it melts grip and advanced and woof amazing same with tommy gun grip and advanced on that is my fav in the game rite now. Mind I hated them in the beginning but venturing off for something dif. And glad I did I think all 3 are better than the ppsh,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,That music is so annoying,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,the overall feel of the gun reminds me of how the MP40 was in WaW.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,when the intro is already old news too. :D,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Been loving these lately and I know Im late but good to have you back Hutch. Ive always kinda looked up to you in some wierd way lol,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Everyone was complaining about how you got too much flinch. Now they made it even worse? Uhhhhh,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Advanced rifling doesn't affect the 3 shot kill range for SMGs. Other than that  great vids lately :),Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,advanced rifling doesnt effect the maximum damage range (3 shot range),Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I don't know if you've done a vid about it already  but the Bren is a fucking MONSTER. It's a consistent 2 shot center mass from miles away. Can't get enough of that gun  man. Bren is my fren,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Reminds me of the pp90m1 from mw3.,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I like that you use different guns. Everyone defaults to the BAR its kinda lame,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Bren LMG with rapid fire and the scope  its like a sniper rifle without the optic sway,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Hutch! What is up with this 360p quality!!,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,I'm not a fan of starting the music at the end too early  it ruins any type of tension in the video at that moment. Could you dial it back to the last 20 or 10 seconds maybe?,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,These OMOO vids are easily my fav on YouTube  started watching the live streams,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,The grabbitz intro <333,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Use the Lewis LMG. Highly underrated gun!,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,whys it in 360p?,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,As soon as learned that it's essentially the only 3 shot smg  I tried it out and fucking destroyed with it. You gotta be confident if you're gonna use it,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,oh well hi,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Grease gun is easily my favorite gun,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Not really!,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,the sex icon himself,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,First (:,Hutch,shaun0728
QlOVv1Uxr0c,Love you boo thang <3,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,comment for support,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Who cares even if you were playing Fortnite for the money. You are giving us GOOD  FREE CONTENT. if anyone is complaining they are an entitled idiot. You owe us nothing. Been here since cod 4 and will be here forever.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,damn I remember when hutch used to average like 200k views now hes getting like 15k :(,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Thanks for all you do  Hutch. #Hutch2020,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,We get it hutch!!! You're a hipster and liked this game before it was cool ;),Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Just can't believe you went from a variety gamer/youtuber to being a fortnite youtuber. Used to love watching you play prop hunt with Seananners and Sark  or playing chess  or playing Game battles on Cod4. Now every single video is just fortnite. I agree 100% that you should play what you love to play  but sometimes work isnt always something that is fun  or something you love to do.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Your content is always top notch Hutch. You always make me laugh. Fuck the minority of haters.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Ayy I got an NRA ad on Hutch's channel  I wonder how he'd feel about that.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Gay game,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,You actually started in October ;),Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Fuck the haters! Been watching you for a while now. Thanks for being my lunch time entertainment! Keep up the good work bud! x,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,The biggest problem is just that EVERYONE IS PLAYING IT! you can not find a channel you used to watch that hasn't done a at least a series of videos on it and from an entertainment point of view it's simply burnout. 500k videos on fortnite and only fortnite from people for months and months on end just gets old. But Hutch is right. you shoudl play what you want to play.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,How do you guys build so efficiently? I can't do it for shit but i'm so determined to learn!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,This game is already dead for me tbh  i played it sooo much and it started frustrating me aswell  which actually made me switch back to CoD:WW2 which has been improved a bit.  BUT BUT BUT! Im subscribed because of Hutch! Not cause of the fucking games. You shouldnt subscribe to a Youtuber cause he plays Fortnite or something else. Subscribe because you like the dude... and who doesnt like Hutch?    No seriously  who doesnt like Hutch? ill fucking cut you! lol,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Today I found out this game made over $225 million the month of March. Absolutely ridiculous and definitely a "cash cow" of a game. Now you  and many other YouTubers I currently watch  hopping on the train? Definitely not. I know for at least you  you've been riding this battle bus for months now. You don't put 1000+ hours into a game purely bc it can make you a couple extra bucks. You do it because you enjoy it. I've put almost 500 hours into this game and that probably puts it in the top 5 games all time for me.   Fuck the haters hutch  do you boo boo.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I watch every single fortnight highlights video you post on here. I also really enjoy the game. Im not into livestreams but i definitely  dig what you're doing.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,You should for sure do the interviews with old YouTube buddies like you used to do. Those were awesome,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutch  I'd love to see you do a tabletop RPG. I think I remember Sark threatening to do a session or two with the Respawn crew a long  long time ago.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,As to your reply to the small number of negative comments accusing you of using this game as a "cash cow:" Hogwash. We've seen your enthusiasm for this game non-stop. As you said  before the game exploded.  You do you  and I expect nothing else.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,longer vids!!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,you fucking suck at this game lol,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Does J not play Fortnite?,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I do miss omoo but this game is truly incredible and I cant stop playing,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Love you playing Fortnite. I have said it before  I enjoy it all the more when you're playing with someone else.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutch  I don't think you switched to this game because it was a cash cow  anyone saying that wasn't here for the switch. I dislike it because I don't find it engaging to watch. You keep doing you and I'll keep watching the highlights,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I love playing Fortnite but the shotguns are a flat out disease in this game that is sucking alot of the fun out,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Noahj45-17 000 is pretty good at this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Great title,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I really don't understand why anyone would complain about someone playing a game because they think it will make them money...  Ideally it's better to play something you love  but you gota eat and sometimes you put out content that's popular but not really your favorite/fun thing.  People who disagree should think about the vast amounts a media we have all over the place putting out just tons of stuff.  Seriously  i doubt very much that there isn't literally thousands of actors/writers/reporters who do work they don't fully "love" just to pay the bills.  There's nothing wrong with doing something you don't enjoy to make ends meet  because when push comes to shove there's a lota jobs out there that no one really enjoys doing but they have to get done.  Now that being said ideally  if you can  you should do what you love.  So if Hutch loves this game and can make money by putting out content on it  more power to him.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Whew I thought hutch was gonna miscalculate his shield math again.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I think that it's definitely true a lot of people have switched to this game because it's a cash cow  but Hutch is one of the few people I know for sure didn't switch for that reason. I still remember when he first started posting this stuff on his channel and I definitely still wasn't on board  I was actually really bummed to see a fortnite video pop up in my feed. But then I watched this video where I heard him talking about how excited he was about the game and how he hadn't been this hungry to improve in a very long time and there wasn't a trace of insincerity in his voice. I found myself utterly unable to fault him for switching games because it actually made me jealous how excited he was about it. I decided to give the game the chance hutch had given it (at least from a viewing perspective) and as it turns out it's really entertaining to watch people having fun with a game  and I grew to really like watching fortnite.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Life Lessons with Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,3:23 to skip past the insecurity.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,what ever man just do what makes you happy me and a lot more ppl will just move on to somthing new .. bloody hate this game,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutch is the best,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,love your stuff hutch  keep on keeping on,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I actually felt the exact same as you Hutch.  I got it on xbox only because I was waiting for PUBG which I thought was superior at the time.  Played a couple rounds and immediately loved it.  Got PUBG once it was avail for xbox and didnt like it nearly as much.  I wont lie I stopped watching newer COD game videos and would only watch chess/Rocket league etc but started watching again relgiously with Fortnite.  Keep up the good work bro!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I dig watching you play any shooter tbh,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I remember watching Hutch's first fortnite video  and I wanted to try the game  but didn't really have $70 to spend on a new game. Then at some point Hutch said it was free  and I figured it was just for PC. Basically learned it was also on xbox and PS4  and have now been playing since November. Crazy to think I've already been playing for half a year...,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,But the Sandy  Trex  Xcal squad is prettttyyyy  preettttttttttyyyyyyyyyy pretty good (Larry david voice),Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I love Hutch and Noah together,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Play gay chicken with Hector,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,keep doing what you do hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,You guys remember MW2 era YouTube? I honestly think it's just happening again with Fortnite. Sure there are some people that are 2018 whiteboy7thst with "giveaways for likes" and shit  but there's still a lot of people loving this game for what it is and are pushing content that is enjoyable. I'm with it  especially with Hutch. If you're a Hutch subscriber and you've been here for a while  you should know that he's not here for the "cash cow." He's really enjoying himself.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Really dig the streams and highlights. Keep up the work Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Keep doing what you're doing. It's epic!!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,TCT!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Fornite pinktage? ;) Keep up with the awesome content dude.,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,But everyone did switch to fortnite to keep the channels alive,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Ive named my rabbit hutch. Let that sink in,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutch what do you think about the President of South Korea saying that Trump should receive the nobel peace prize? Love ya man!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,this game is not a cash cow. half of the players are bots T.T,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,I love you hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutch u suck,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Love ya Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,First - Can this comment prove that hutch reads his comments,Hutch,shaun0728
wFW8uS2m7SA,Hutchy poo,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,can you do commentaries about life?,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Loving the highlights!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,ive been watching since mw2  still love the content! just started playing this game bc of you. its amazing! Big thanks man,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,As I'm in Europe  watching streams is really hard. I therefore prefer videos like this!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Thanks for posting the whole game. Very enjoyable. Great finish.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,When you say kick your feet up and relax  i really end up enjoying it so much more. best intro ever. best youtuber ever,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Ill be so happy when another game takes your interest from this one. This is such a fucking boring game to watch  even worse then PUBG.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,04:30 = Real life Rick Sanchez,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Why you look like an aggressive rapist,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I like watching your these long matches you post because I never have the extra time to watch the streams.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,For what it's worth I prefer whole gameplays.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Can't make the streams  so I love the longer gameplay. But pleasing both crowds is diversifying that shit so sounds good to me! Keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,SUCK DICKS,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Without the whole game the kills don't really have context   I prefer the whole games tbh,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,There's nothing wrong with stream clips imo. Not everybody watches the stream and it still takes effort to edit. But You're right  I think mixing both is a good call,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hutch what would you be playing if Fortnite didnt become so popular over the past few weeks?,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,hutch I'm in another group. I was just straight up enjoying those vids  so if you decide to keep them that way I'm cool with that,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Maven sounds so different,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I like some videos  and others  not as much. You do your thing  and we'll watch the videos we do enjoy. Cheers!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hutch  PLEASE try four man chess. It is so much fun  and I would really like to see you try it,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Holy shit  Hutch & Jack unleashing hell at the end!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,full gameplay for squads and duos  highlights for solo imo,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Havent commented in the past but as a sub my preference leans towards the full gameplays more tbh - not sure I think Fortnite lends itself as much to compilation vids but sounds like not everyone shares that opinion. Play what you wanna play  produce what you wanna produce man.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,He DOES read the comments  he does  he DOES! haha Anywho  I can see how much you love this game  and your enthusiasm is why I come here  not the game. Keep on keeping on brotha.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Is Hutch adopting Nanners' Racoon Style?,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,GG,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Best Fortnite gameplay video so far. Loved the tower building.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Oh shit  you read the comments  Hutch? Well  hi there. You're awesome and you should keep up all that you do. Keep on being the sexual idol for gaming that you are,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,full game-plays will always be my vote,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Dig up stupid!!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Another great video  thank you Shaun.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,In my opinion if it's a good game from your stream I see no issue with you posting it to YouTube. Love you hutch  keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I think this is the best game you have uploaded so far goddamn,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Keep doing what your doing. It's good.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hutch you can try to please everyone but ultimately you'll just over stress yourself love you man do what makes you happy,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Highlights for sure,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hell yeah! nice gameplay Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Cant please the masses stick to whats working full uncut videos...its the banter people watch for,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,These full playthroughs are way better. You should do some Fortnite Challenges~,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Man I started playin this game cus of your vids got to last 2 and blew myself up lol the vid is on my channel,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Suck dicks lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,AYee i was in the first game of this vid. died before i saw hutch but that game was pretty epic.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Full gameplays are better. Its not my fault people out there with add riddled goldfish attention spans.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,The highlights will come with the good gameplay (such as this vid)... if anything  the thing I love about the streams is the great banter and funny topics.  Perhaps those could be the "highlight reel" that your editor creates as opposed to just kills/clutch moments.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I agree I think that  a mix of both is ideal for everyone,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Great game  great content. Keep it going,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,You got such a bad habit to not reload your sniper...its so frustrating to see you line up a perfect shot and then just nothing happens.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Yeah  it's super lazy.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hey Hutch  Loving the fortnight videos. Either full videos or split up  it's all hutch so it's all good. Keep it up!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,This guy going on about how he's drunk like he's 14 drinking for the first time in high school.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Hutch Cheers for always doing your best to please everyone and not just put shit up for contents sake! This is just one reason why you have and always will be one of the OG Kings of YouTube. Keep it up Dawg,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,That was an outstanding game!!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I don't care how you make it  just please for the love of god make sure you have a bullet/rocket in the chamber before you shoot,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I personally don't give a shit what you do  because whatever you do  will be interesting in its own way. Whether streams or highlights  whatever game or chess. I think some people are just fickle and it is a form of a power trip to tell people what they should do.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I like both the highlights and full game plays! But that ending was crazy with the rocket launchers GG Hutch!!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Also who the fuck is CouRageJD and why is he such a beast with a shotgun,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Do what makes you happy Hutch. I will always watch your videos. And i think a mix of full and highlight videos is a great idea,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Jebus fortnight is getting TOO popular the servers are borked. There's a 60 min wait right now to login and you still can't get in a game.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Im a fairly busy person so I never really catch streams ever. Thanks for posting these,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Full entertaining gameplays are the best !,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Have you tried the console version yet hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I really hope your edited videos take off. Best of luck.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,appreciate ya,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,A good mix of both is great. I prefer long matches  but kinda warming up to highlights. As long as the videos are 15+ mins  I'm good with it.   And *I'm* never able to catch any of your streams  so thank you for putting them on YouTube.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,That's awesome Hutch! Keep on doing what your doing! I'll Keep watching and commenting!,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,i think the majority of your fans sometimes watch your vids simply just to feel like we're chilling with you sometimes. i know i do. personally prefer the full games because i like the nitty gritty  gaming aint always pretty and shouldn't have to be dolled up. either way  i watch all your content period. much love hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,In regards to trying to please everyone of your fans (or at least the majority): Most of us are old fans of yours. Most of us have been here for years and are used to the stability of a certain type of awesomeness from your content.  I think it would be better for you to just make the content that makes you the most happy. That's when we see the Hutch we want to see... whether it be "muted  hardcore mode Hutch" to "all the feels Hutch" it's blatant when you're enjoying yourself  and we enjoy watching that. If I recall  in the past  you've said something to that effect.  You do you  Good Sir. You do you.  Also  it seems a minority of comments from the last two highlight videos come off entitled and  some borderline  rude. A pretty rare and odd thing to see 'round these parts.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,way to listen to your fans. Good shit hutch btw you are so lucky you know Ben Simmons lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,Alot of respect for reading the comments and actually making an effort  you tha best,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,I prefer the mix. I personally love the full gameplays but when its switched up and a sick highlight video is that perfect switchup. Love the content.,Hutch,shaun0728
O9eUePKX6G8,1st,Hutch,shaun0728

XFNFAgLW6wQ,"How about you using your mouth and suck my dick" could have easily been a Mr. Sark respawn inbox reply XD,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,"I need you deep inside of me  passionately thrusting" "I'm cumming!",Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,I love when hutch get super competitive. The "Get out of my fffFFFFFACE" had me dying,Hutch,shaun0728

XFNFAgLW6wQ,That fucking intro... Christ..,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,The "opticmaniac hasn't been relevant in the tournament scene since 2008" line was so harsh and so funny.  I love Hutch's laugh at it.  I'm in tears.,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,Sons of Gondor!  Of Rohan!  My brothers.  I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.  A day may come when the courage of Men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship  but it is not this day.  An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down  but it is not this day!  This day we fight!  By all that you hold dear on this good earth  I bid you stand  Men of the West!,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,nice i actually highlighted the title clip in this vid,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,Pasionatly Thrusting wouldve made the better title indeed,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,UUUHHHHH!   lol,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,anyone have the chopsticks clip?,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,Damn  dude. Hutch is badass at this game,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,We subbed for the commentary tbh don't care about gameplay  and when I say commentary I don't mean play by play I mean personable smart and deep classic hutch commentary :(,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,You saw the title and you knew EXACTLY how he was gonna say it,Hutch,shaun0728
XFNFAgLW6wQ,BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY! Great movie  great vid.,Hutch,shaun0728

XFNFAgLW6wQ,1st,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,why Hutch give him the meds,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,You guys talk like you've never payed a FPS game before. He isn't being an asshole  he's being efficient  loot immediately and sort it out later (notice he does give up a shield pot) if you sit around thinking about min/maxing the drops you will get your stupid ass sniped. This isn't inventory management simulator this is a battle royale.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,"Hey guy that just got downed and has like 30 health  there's a medpack over there by Hutch." "Oh shit  I have 68 hp? That'd be a waste of a bandage  lemme just use this medpack.",Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,GGs,Hutch,shaun0728

Xq0_RFyPbgY,Are you also a hoarder IRL as well Hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Hutch at 68 hp  his boy just came up from down state. Takes med kit  gets impatient drowns his buddy out and steals the shield potion. Gameplay says a lot about personality,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Haha so many comments about the loot.. nice seeing you play with Noah j,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Hutch is the greediest mother fucker in this game,Hutch,shaun0728

Xq0_RFyPbgY,This game is bringing out an ugly side of my man Hutch :(,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,More WW2 plz,Hutch,shaun0728

Xq0_RFyPbgY,Lmfao you take all the loot greeder goth coulda got to 100 health he was at 30,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Hutch how are you gonna say to your teammates "Oh  theres another medkit here!" and then you just grab it and run...,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Play pubg you fucking scrub,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Horrendous teammate  but so fun to watch.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Good to see some gameplay with Noah! Keep up the great content Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728

Xq0_RFyPbgY,At the end I was anxious for you not seeing him lol,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Is this white bitch being greedy again?,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,if hutch keeps this greedy shit up he might as well just play solo,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Great gameplay! You shouldn't be so selfish you are hurting your team though,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,You deserve a million subs  keep the vids coming :))),Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Un Ban me! Even though your a liberal A Hole! I still love watching your streams!,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,I know he streams super early in the morning but you should try to play with dakotaz. The man is insane at this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Hutch is the worst teammate lol,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,I've been deliberately team killed by people who are better team players than Hutch haha,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Lol. My friend is the same way with loot. He'll pick up all the loot before reviving teammates.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,TWO VIDEOS ONE DAY?!!?? WOOOOOO,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,I didn't like the videos on this game at first  but from watching all of them I love the game and videos you keep making on them !,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,hutch u aint getting shit from santa this year,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Is this game fun played solo? I can't get enough of these gameplays  but don't have a party to play with so I haven't picked it up yet.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,loot trumps friendship,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,thats KING Gothalion to you,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,it's so satisfying to see the people you're playing with actually fuck up as much shit as you instead of you carrying the team every time,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,I feel the same way about this game. Took me a while to play it but once I did the graphics grew on me and the game is an absolute blast,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,all the fucking content coming from this guy. way to be hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,come on boys  my asshole isn't going to eat itself.,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Throws away med kits at the start of the video?,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,I thought this was rust at first from the thumbnail,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Sit back and relax time,Hutch,shaun0728
Xq0_RFyPbgY,Hi,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Cruising through all your Fortnite highlight vids  you got a lot better Hutch  good on ya,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,People complain that a full play through is boring  then the same people complain that cutting down to highlights loses the 'narrative'..,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Why would you cut right at 6:03?,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,I appreciate that wally has put in time for these 2 videos he's done and highlights can make content more digestible. However  transitions are rough  no music  theme   just kinda dull outside of your own gameplay and dialogue interactions.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Fortnite is too cartoony to fully enjoy. I personally think the game is absolute horseshit. Building shit while in a gunfight? The fuck kind of shit is that? Not to mention the game is just about as redundant as it can get. Constant running long ass distances. Boring.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Love the video!  Fortnite is joe enjoyable then PUBG to watch.  I love the game mainly because now my gf and I can play a multiplayer game and post it on my channel. Haha,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Hey Hutch I was wondering where you pay attention to the bill that forced people to use proper pronouns.  Looks like it passed and the government is telling what you can say?,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,These new videos make me feel less attached to the Hutchy-poo.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Hutch  I like this format but I like your usual better.  I find your Fortnite BR far more enjoyable than PUBG gameplay.  Two salty old thumbs way up!,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Love your vids man. Keep it up.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,A solid no to these highlight videos,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Hutch banning people of color in your twitch chat is really racist and uncalled for.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,I love the highlights much better when you're playing Fortnite.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,On the real  hutch is getting good at this game,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Maybe it's just me  but I want the longer vids back where we can hear all of your antics. Not just clips  no talk or any of that. I'd rather have 2 30 minute videos of decent gameplay than 1 10 minute video of just clips.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Please play pubg instead. These devs copy and pasted this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Mmmm yeah keep that fortnite shit up Hutch! Love it,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Bring back your old style of videos  and fire your editor who is just using windows movie maker transitions...,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,is that you?  yes!  BOOM,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,It's always great to see someone happy. <3 keep doing what you love hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,I cannot figure out this game for the life of me. I've never been so bad at another game. I'm drawn to keep playing it though just because I'm so baffled by it.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,YouTubeBrock has way better Stream Highlight videos.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,I love watching you play Fortnite but i have trouble with it being highlights because you become more attached to the kill feeds when you have the story that lead to the feed. and god damn it hutch i love to hear you talk. at this point  I click on your video have it play on the background and head to your twitch and watch the games in full.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,I love these highlights  i've been playing this game so much too. Any friends here want to link up and play together too?,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Really love these highlight clips. It gets old pretty quick when you know a guy's going to win every video based on the length of the upload.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Good stuff Hutch  glad to see you taking a larger interest in editing videos for Youtube.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,0:40 Hutch  you are definitely not bad at videogames. Even the best of the best can get hit and/or taken down by something they didn't see or expect.  I am bad at videogames haha  because I play casually  not "to win" but to enjoy myself. I still try to win though  but I rarely make it =),Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Is CoD dead? Less than two weeks to release and no one is talking about it.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Hard pass on the transitions and on the no face cam.,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,that one guy sound like ethan from h3 somehow,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,i cant stand watching games like fortnite or pubg. theyre so boring,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,would love to see the old style of video back,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,wally needs to make these videos flow a little better,Hutch,shaun0728
nhWCGEXKn0M,Hey Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728

T-HF29he_IM,Great post as always Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
T-HF29he_IM,I have the exact same sentiment Hutch.  I remember watching his vids and this motherfucker's ending is Sark-level  but he didn't get nearly as many views.  He's like Harley from EMT.  He commands a room with sheer charisma and presence but not in a bullying way.  He's just fuckin awesome.  And when I heard he blew the fuck up  I was shocked like "is that the same Doctor from five years ago?"  So happy for him,Hutch,shaun0728
T-HF29he_IM,Damn you beast!,Hutch,shaun0728
T-HF29he_IM,does the doc enjoy WW2? I stopped into his stream during the beta and he was pretty displeased with it,Hutch,shaun0728

T-HF29he_IM,Am I the only one that remembers Dr.DisRespect always calling out Hutch in ALL of his vids? Back then I thought Hutch was the Doc from how many times he brought him up,Hutch,shaun0728
T-HF29he_IM,Didn't sound like a good time yesterday.,Hutch,shaun0728
T-HF29he_IM,I just had some corn bread and it was pretty good.,Hutch,shaun0728

2UEhRzBd32o,Your ear is sore because you wear huge headphones all day.,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Hey Hutch  Any chance you could not start the music until the game is actually over?  I don't usually notice the length of the video or how close to the end I am while I'm watching it and it's a bit of a spoiler. Kinda kills the suspense.  Just a suggestion  keep up the good work.,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,So close hutchy! Gg love the duo with hector,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,wish i could get that 17 min back :(,Hutch,shaun0728

2UEhRzBd32o,That was a genuine backpack.,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,I got a blue house with a blue window,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Also... Where is that stream shnuckems?,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Always try to avoid attacking someone above you.   You get to frantic at the end of games and bull rush them.  Need to try and take it slower at the end of a game.,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,"I've never backpacked so hard in my life" video starts with Hutch screaming,Hutch,shaun0728

2UEhRzBd32o,So much fucking carry  holy shit,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Is hector good at any game ever? My eyes bleed every time hutch steals every bit of loot although he deserves to in this,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Sometimes my ear gets sore from my headset too,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Why does he always leave the green at for the gray one ???,Hutch,shaun0728
2UEhRzBd32o,Yeah  doing dishes was the worst as a kid. I had to do dishes  and my sister put them away after they dried  and she would always try to argue that her job was harder  WHICH IS ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT,Hutch,shaun0728

2UEhRzBd32o,Picking up Hector? Sounds like just another day for Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728

j8B5I5YEwwE,Hutch  just stop with politics. We know you're on the left. We know you hate the right. This doesn't mean things you like to hear are "non partisan" issues. Of course her speech was politicised.. it was a political message. They're the Hollywood elites. They're not even hiding their political bias.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,hey Hutch  just wanted to let you know that H2ODelerious has some really creative ways of using what fortnight gives you. Since you wanted to elevate your game  there might be some good tips to keep improving ;) as always awesome vid!,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,FUCK OPRAH,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,that sniper shot though,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,When it comes to shooting games I hope they never make it cross platform  besides ps and Xbox  but never console and pc.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Theres nothing inspiring about the speech. Just pure virtue signaling. Stick to the games Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Do More Videos with Mr Sark,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Hah  I remember thinking  a short while ago after one of your videos where you said the silenced pistol sucked  that you'd come around to it later,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Hutch any chance on a chess game ?,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Oprah's speech was trash because it was hollow. You really think the most powerful woman in show business had no idea that women were being abused and exploited in Hollywood? She only speaks up now because it benefits her. She's garbage  just like the rest of them.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,I think on pc its better than a shotgun but on console ill take a pump,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,She knew tho,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Hey hutch  ive been watching you forever  since cod 4. I was wondering if your still thinking about doing the personal talk commentary  like stories and thoughts. I used to love watching yours  nanners  and jeriicos old videos like that  because i felt like i knew  you guys  idk just miss the old days of youtube. Hope you start those up again. Keep up the good work Hutchinson,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,anyone else watch hutchs videos/streams for politcial news... no just me? lol love the conversations topics man =],Hutch,shaun0728

j8B5I5YEwwE,No man (or woman) left behind! Unless they're in the storm in which case build a little base to make sure you're safe. Come on Hutch you could have gone back into the storm and rev'd her. It was a single tick  she was close and she said he was using bandages so it'd have been an easy kill. Not cool! Love you tho' Hutchy.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Hutch you're a dirty faggot,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,How do you remove the long range shadows?,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Thanks for putting artist and song title,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,I just wanna say I appreciate you using your platform to educate and promote the issues that are important to you. Not many people in the gaming community are willing to do that. It's inspiring and I really respect you for that. Keep it real  shaun0728.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,People thought Oprah's speech was amazing? She was a huge fan of Weinstein until just recently. There's photos of her kissing him. Celebrities are almost all hypocritical trash.,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Wait  how does he have hair again?,Hutch,shaun0728

j8B5I5YEwwE,Would have been epic if you got the W!,Hutch,shaun0728
j8B5I5YEwwE,Hutch  you're the guy. I just wanted to let you know incase you didn't already that a lot of times you put in the description of the video that it features diesel  hector and J from OmoO even when it's a different person. Sometimes I like the person in the video with you or I want to know who they are so I look in the description but it always has the OmoO guys in it. Just wanted to let you know and hope you see this! Thanks you're the GOAT <3,Hutch,shaun0728

kc_9SazwHn0,Hi my name is Hutch  I went from uploading quality videos with full commentary  now I make shitty fortnite videos with no commentary.,Hutch,shaun0728

kc_9SazwHn0,master builder status,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Hutch is selfish af  you can feel the frustration from his teammates,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,You choked on all that loot you hogged!,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,I love Cali!!,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Your a god hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Just wanted to say as a long time fan/viewer of you Hutch  you acted like a complete dick to the guy on twitter last night/this morning who said he was stepping away from your channel. This again comes from someone who agrees with your politics  is fine with you voicing them in your videos  and has followed you for a while. I don't know if it was because it was late at night or what  but you were a complete asshole in the twitter thread. I say this because I like you and think you are a good guy. It honestly lowered my opinion of you. I hope you can look at that conversation and understand how you were wrong. Just a complete 180 to what I would expect from you. The guy was respectful and you treated him like shit. Don't have a twitter and rarely comment on youtube videos but I felt strongly enough about it to comment here  which should tell you something.,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,You're definitely getting hella better at this game and it shows. GG man,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Is it me  or is the crossbow just complete ass? It does little damage  has a short range for a ranged weapon  and has a slow af reload time,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Great building skills but ffs Hutch you got to learn to be a better teammate. You don't share. You make zero attempt to rez your team. It's kind of painful to watch tbh.,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,I must of missed something  does he not like WW2 anyone???,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,wow your shit id of won this,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,I think cali likes hutch...,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,hutch  you are that guy im afraid of meeting ingame,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Your building skills are getting better,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,i watched that live and it was epic....it is even more epic the second time around,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,I love Cali's laugh!,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,If I'm honest  the thumbnails are way too consistent and could use improvement in the quality-department.,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Thats an L,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Been wayyyy too long since you've done a reaction to a Respawn video!!,Hutch,shaun0728

kc_9SazwHn0,Hutch wouldent drop bullets when he had 40 but the other teamates dropped some when she was low on 20 lol . Idk if it's a running joke but hutch really was not taught to share as a child lol,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,Hutch is such a loot hog lol,Hutch,shaun0728
kc_9SazwHn0,That hurt me to my soul!,Hutch,shaun0728

GJtbVQsJvtk,when you put "more" in front of a word you don't have to add "er" to the end of the word! saying "more deadlier" is like saying "more better"! just say more deadly or deadlier!,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,I love you Hutch but oh my god "He's on top of the thing over here... nah he's on the  hold on  he's on the building  the big building  longer building..." lol. He's on the building North East. That's all you got to say. At a push just "North East".,Hutch,shaun0728

GJtbVQsJvtk,Hmm you take out the shotguns and the game becomes more fun wonder what that means...nerf the damn shotguns already,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,I feel like this all gold play list could be the staple for competitive Fortnite. The few games I played felt like RNG didn't effect the game as much because everyone got similar weapons. Would like to see a golden shotgun in the future  like a double barrel.,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,lol hutch has some of the worst call outs haha,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,Do people use macros or the mouse wheel to switch between weapons?,Hutch,shaun0728

GJtbVQsJvtk,Unlimited materials would be a sick game mode,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,Such a toxic teamate,Hutch,shaun0728
GJtbVQsJvtk,Aaaand that lag is what happens when you try to play a shooter at full rendering quality at 150fps and simultaneously upload a video of that game at the same time.,Hutch,shaun0728

WM1PoHGA2tQ,Totally agree about NFEN. No matter who he plays with  his humour always shines through. Sark  APL  you  no matter who he's playing with he just naturally shines as the main source of the laughs. Honestly  love how he synergizes with all of you guys.,Hutch,shaun0728

JVikoiLe0VI,Was a great vid. But im predicting that there is going to be oomoo problems like with Ghosts and AW. There didnt seem like there would be a problem with this game on game battles but these are not well made maps and thats going to cause the game play to feel boring and your going to die a lot more.,Hutch,shaun0728
JVikoiLe0VI,Good ol hutch  more of these vids plz!,Hutch,shaun0728
JVikoiLe0VI,So they spend millions upon millions making the maps  guns  and graphics as realistic and immersive as possible  and then they pull you right out with a loud clicking noise every time you shoot someone. Lol at COD these days.,Hutch,shaun0728
JVikoiLe0VI,Watched this live it was a awesome stream! :D,Hutch,shaun0728
JVikoiLe0VI,Type 100 has great accuracy but shit time to kill.,Hutch,shaun0728

JVikoiLe0VI,Hey Hutch i've been a big fan of the first 2 Call of Duty's because they were about WO II  after that i played very little FPS games which brings me to the following question: I've been struggeling with the fact that peopl can spawn immidiatly in this game and i would like  to know how you keep track where people spawn i find it very hard to understand and its bothering me to the point that i started to play the game less because of it.  Have a nice weekend!,Hutch,shaun0728

4VG1pf2KWGY,is it just me or does hutch's laugh seem forced in these clips?? O.o,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,wait how the fuck did he say the alphabet backwords fucking demon,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,I find the editing to be very flat  the only editing that's really been done is occasional music and "funny subtitles"  which pales in comparison to something like Sarks editing which is pristine and almost adds a second voice to the video. Something similar has happened to Criken2  where he's outsourced his editing to random guys on youtube who don't seem to have much of a portfolio behind them. I get that it's more of a business thing than anything else  and it's still funny obviously  it just could be so much better.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,How the fuck did you say the alphabet backwards?,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,3:10 Pookie  ;),Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,These highlights are genuinely hilarious. More plz.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,This stream was hilarious,Hutch,shaun0728

4VG1pf2KWGY,Lovin the highlight videos. They make my day,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,I'm convinced that every channel needs more xcal. Dude's a legend.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Xcal!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,I like you and I like your personality I feel like we can relate. But when you always bring up politics it's hard to watch you  we need to be united as one not bitch at one side and the other.. much love peace. I can't watch this anymore,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,For the record  i dont think you are ugly. Hey play some chess!,Hutch,shaun0728

4VG1pf2KWGY,Dude.....  Before I say this  let me be clear.  I AM NOT A TRUMP SUPPORTER....  But if you think Obama was a good president you seriously need to do just tad bit of research....  please start with the way we handled Syria and Libya....  Then possibly move on to the drone program...  Also his BS about raising minimum wage for 8 years was very entertaining...,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,The legendary xcal I miss him :'(,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,666th like!,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,yes. please play with bruce more,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Your white guilt is sickening.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,This was great bud  great editing  with you on the politics. Everyone's got a point  we all need to get along  help a bunch of everyone with school and money and GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS  IT'S FUCKING EVERYONE UP THEY JUST PEDDLE LIES TO PEOPLE TO GET MORE RICH. I don't care about rich or poor  I just want everyone an equal educated voice and it will equilibrium out.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,I don't think the word overlay style of video editing works well for you  Hutch. I can't explain it but it's just less enjoyable with the text than without it. Love your vids in general though.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,The whole match where the clip at 8:38 is from was so fucking magical. They almost lost the game like twice but ended up winning it. It was so nice to watch on stream.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,excellent video. My favorite highlight vid so far.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,i love this more! more please haha,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,It's zed  not zee. Better luck next time ;),Hutch,shaun0728

4VG1pf2KWGY,hey pal  what's your favorite flavor of vape juice to use? many thanks  friend,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,who cares about your personal politics? Opinions are like assholes  everyone has one and they all stink.. no one wants to hear someone else talk shit,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,this is fantastic. good job to hutch and his majestic editer.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Man the editing is on point! Just in case the editor is reading this  I think its great that you actually read the feedback and change the way you edit! I think this style is just perfect for the highlights  not too drastic with the zooms/captions but also not boring. Keep it up!,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,hot damn its good to hear xcal is alive and well,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,gj on the editing and you're not THAT old hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,hutch  even though you're old and ugly you're still loved,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,More Sandy and Xcal adventures  please.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Aw  I've missed Sandy  Fick and XCal since the BO2 days.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Cuck,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Man as I get older and continue to play FPS game I find myself getting mad at my friends as well when playing. There are some days that are just awesome  always laughing even if I'm not winning  we're having fun. Other times  I try to actually win and then I start pointing out things my teammates do that just get me so worked up  just like you at the end hutch. I've always stopped playing for the night when it gets to that point because I never wanna get mad at my friends for not doing everything I say because I know I fuck up just as much. I don't watch your streams because I work full time and can't afford that amount of time but i watch your vids here. How do you deal with yourself getting mad even when you know sometimes you're being irrational in your head? [sorry im 8/10 baked],Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Seemed like a third of it was highlights of the game and the rest was just stream highlights,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Oh shit Xcal  been a while since i heard that voice.,Hutch,shaun0728

4VG1pf2KWGY,Spilling your beer is the adult equivalent of accidentally letting go of your balloon on your birthday,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,I didn't realize I needed drunk hutch streams but now I don't know how I lived without it,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Sorry but when Sandy said "im white"  i lost it completely,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Ayy  it's Xcal!,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,How Hutch has not been able to surpass the 920-950k subs area is beyond me. You've deserved 1M + for a long time.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,"I wanna have sex with Barack Obama." This is the content that keeps me coming back to the 927K club.,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Thats it  im coming back to the streams,Hutch,shaun0728
4VG1pf2KWGY,Hutch I've followed you for well over 10 years   from well beyond machinima. Your content Is always awsome and I love watching you on ww2 and fortnite. Keep up the great work buddy! P.s I hope you read this :),Hutch,shaun0728

8U-U7BQPPCM,This was a great game  Loving the stream!,Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,Anyone else think its bad thing when they change games all the time? Bug fixes etc are just fine but I hate when I finally learn to use something in the game and then they change it. (Not talking about Fortnite but in general),Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,Sandy is such a monster already at this game  his snipes are juicy,Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,Friggin epic hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,Since the lack of support for MW2  it seems like the Devs of games have really focused on community support.,Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,Sandy is a fucking god at this game  hope to see you play with him some more lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
8U-U7BQPPCM,God fortcrap again,Hutch,shaun0728

yIMfGMVrXDQ,10:50 man... My goodness...,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I can respect someone for using their platform to state their opinions  especially on important issues  but damn dude I watch Fortnite videos to escape from politics and the world for a bit. I come here for entertainment  just let my mind melt for a few minutes!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I know this meme is used a lot  but "Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne". Also love the chemistry between you and Sark. Good shit.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,i live in WA i smoke for PTSD and diverticulitis the gov is making it very hard to live off of painpills and they were killing me before i moved to weed i don't want to go back,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,People will riot. We just got recreational weed in Cali. There's so many stores in Vegas too. It would take a lot to shut everyone down. We do waste a ton of resources on a bunch of other shit so it's not too hard to imagine them wasting it on this.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,100% believe hutch Im a complete savage with I'm high,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,where do I  a swedish man  call to complain about this?,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,A majority in this country think Marijuana should be legal?  A majority in this country don't know who fought in the civil war.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Decriminalized?  Sure.  Legalized?  No.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sick gameplay wow,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sark FTW.  I like you two in this game  or any game.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,wooow thats sum premo plays right there!!!!!!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch  when President Trump says something  it tends to reflect one of two things: The people he is trying to impress  or the last person he talked to. Hit the bong  and relax,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,15K bless,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,5 minutes Hutch  5 fucking minutes... This is why i skip over your vids now days.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Legalize. Freedom,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,damn hutch nice editing everything is just on point,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Marijuana is a plant. I am an adult. As an adult I'm making the decision of rolling this plant in paper  lighting it with fire and inhaling  the smoke. If i can be a productive citizen and decent person under the effects of such action then the government shouldn't be allowed to take my freedom of choice away.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,jesus christ just play the game and stop bringing politics and your own bullshit opinions into the gameplay.  I'm not here to watch CSPAN  I'm here for a funny fortnite video,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,WHAT WE WONT BE ABLE TO SMOKE MORE WEED!?!?! who give a shit....,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,too much talking at the beginning,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I had no idea hutch smokes the devils lettuce,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I don't mind videos like this from time to time. I think it's a great way to keep people informed especially if they're like me and don't really go out of their way to look at current events or things of that sort. The gameplay at the beginning didn't distract too much from the topic of discussion and vise versa  a nice balance. Appreciate your work Hutch. Also  I think getting together with Nanners and Sark and doing a respawn type video like once a month or something like that would be kind of neat. Even if it's just ya'll going out to eat or being goobers around town.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I actually watched this live. So dope.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I'm not against Marijuana in general but I am pissed off by the Marijuana addicts coming to claim that it is so much better than alcohol. No it isn't.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I loved the whole vid  man. Keep doing what you're doing and don't take shit from anybody.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch i love ya man but u have yo realise the hypocracy in what ur saying. We need federal health care that overides states choices... we want schoolong federally funded. We want we want we want big government. But then u say well the government is overiding states rights by enforcing federal law. Love ya bud but its either one or the other,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sarks commentary is just gold.  "I have to review the footage to confirm that  coz  Im pretty sure  you threw a bale of columbian shit into a fire place.* Dead hahahaha,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Is weed code for busting lines of Adderall ??,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I wish Sark was my dad.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Wtf  I got a cialis ad for the video.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Its not hard to miss with a shotgun though lol..... its like the gun i used to teach my gf how to play call of duty. Hate how this game makes you have to use shotguns at close range or you loose like 80% of close range encounters,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hi hutch..  i feel you on the way to be independent on natural medicin. but...why are you this narrow and zero sighted?. i need an answer  USA is so  big  why can't you change they way of the 1500 bc ??? not to hate  but please fuck me  danish,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,#1 fortnite player = customgrow420,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Love the video as always and I know I'm a little late with the comment  but I wanted to say I love the guy you're playing with. He's fucking hilarious. Nice game bro.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I have played with many people that play better high. I dont puff but i do believe.  Actually... I don't need to believe because i have proof.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I didnt know Sark or Hutch toked  especially after im sure both said they didnt  good shit boys  keep it up!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch i live in Vermont we just legalized recreational througn legislation,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,This has to be the single greatest gameplay in the history of youtube. Well done my friend  well done.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I'm glad you touched on this topic  its honestly silly it is legal in some and not all states in the first place. Sessions will take us back to the 70's and is already showing the pre-cursors in that direction...we need to push for total legalization  not back to "marijuana is more harmful than heroin" - actual Session Papa Crazy Quote  the saddest part is  there are people in my state that actual think like this  still to this day as well...,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,What a game,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I am a simple man. I see Hutch & Sark  I click.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,The combination of you two man..  Pure sex  rough and sweaty sex.,Hutch,shaun0728

yIMfGMVrXDQ,Amazing video... And does Sark stream often?,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,damnnn that was a GAME,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I was excited to watch this video then was immediately turned off by the political nonsense. Nothing is going to happen hutch the government is making to much money on it unsubed.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,You guys are gods and sark has the best commentary,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,well thats an intro that i never want to endure again.. just wanted to watch funny sark and hutch clip  instead get preached to in 5min long intro.... lame wtf has youtube turned into? its all self promotion  preaching and straight bs FFS..,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,i like this style of video,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,The U.S. is not a democracy you dumb fuck. Shut your liberal shit up and fucking play video games.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,2:39 sounds exactly like Bill Burr,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,can you TALK LESS at the beginning of the video please?,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,It's the AG's job to enforce the laws on the books. It is the legislature's job to change the laws. It's easy as that.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch is the shit for boofin that Pac,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I miss the old respawn days  there was a lot of bad but some great things as well!  Sark and hutch combo was one of them!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,fast forward to 5:25 if you don't want to hear about stupid politics in this video.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,so fucking hyped hutch a pot head ima bring my illadelph to you and pack you rips,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sark on the thumbnail = guaranteed view from me. I love you two.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,My hands got sweaty just watching this,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sark is fucking insane lmfao I don't even know which anecdote to laugh at most,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch finishes his political rants at 4:11,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Unreal,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Cannot wait to see Mr. Sarks video for this ;),Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I'm undecided about the health implications of marijuana  erring on the side of negative impact to people. I feel there isn't enough research into the long term effects  so a 30-40 years of legality may be necessary to conduct sufficient appropriate studies.  In particular  mental health seems to suffer long term. If more and more studies confirm this  then I personally think recreational usage definitely needs to be either HEAVILY regulated  or made illegal.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Sark is the God Father  and you're Father Time :),Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I play muuuch better high. And yea fortnite makes my heart pump..,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I thought that a couple years ago  that you didn't care for the effects weed had on you that you got paranoid and didn't enjoy it anymore? Maybe I'm thinking of someone else.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Hutch! love ya man  but ive never watched your videos for the politics. I watch your videos to chill out  laugh  and relax. So take the politics out of gaming  and MAKE VIDEOS GREAT AGAIN LOL,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,SKIP TO 5:09 !!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,What gets my gibber in a gibby is the fact that conservatives generally wish to do the opposite of regulate the free market  yet they will support politicians who wish to restrict it. Makes you wonder if capitalism is inherently unstable and the free market is a paradox in and of itself.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,are you a god?,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Why tf is Hutch a beast at this game? How the hell can I become a beast at this game? X'D,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Have you ever thought about changing your name to Clutch? Because  holy shit  the things you do in this game.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I totally support you on this buddy    its totally good to use but the problem is dumb people keep judging its bad if your'e under 18 it mess up the brain development and can cause serious problems but if your'e older its totally fine for those people who ''Died' because of it like lets say suicide they probably did it because of hidden depression or prejudice from others i think that instead of kicking them out of our society and just throwing them in prison is not gonna make it better for them also it creates revenue from taxes (According to a new report from New Frontier Data states with legalized marijuana are on track to approximately 65 million revenue from taxes reaching about 1 billion in just a few months Forbes.com) and jobs which the growing US population extremely need it (In 2015  the legal marijuana industry in Colorado created more than 18 000 new full-time jobs and generated $2.4 billion in economic activity  according to a first-of-its-kind analysis of the economics of legal cannabis in the state.  The study  conducted by the economic consulting firm Marijuana Policy Group   is based on two years of sales numbers from the state of Colorado. It measured both the direct effects of legalization -- including close to $1 billion in retail sales in 2015 -- and the industry's spillover effects on the Colorado economy.  These indirect impacts of marijuana legalization came from increased demand on local goods and services: growers rent warehouse space and purchase sophisticating lighting and irrigation equipment  for instance. Marijuana retailers similarly rely on other companies  like contractors  lawyers and book-keeping services  to conduct their own business) think about the economic terms,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,making weed illegal just supports cartels like what happened when booze got illegalize,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Watching these two guys will never get old.  They really are the wise men of YouTube.  Atleast with gaming.  Great video and I like how u threw in a little twist with the bud. Great way to spread awareness. If you don't abuse it then it's smooth sailing just like that win.  Nice.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,yo your editor is fucking incredible. great gameplay dude,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Did anyone else kinda cringe when he left the med pack? 11:12,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,YOU POSTED IT! I was watching during the stream  the energy was crazy. Very well played match and it was a pleasure having Sark's commentary.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Jamaican Black Castor Oil for hair hutch. Look into it.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,Lmfaoo,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,The Jeff Sessions bullshit is genuinely scary to me. I've dumped a very large percentage of my savings into starting a grow operation in my home state  where cannabis has been legalized for recreational use. I don't honestly think the DEA alongside most DAs in most states will give enough fucks to start going after people  but the idea that I might have dumped most of my worth for nothing scares the shit out me.,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,I never knew Sark partook in the gigglebush! All of my favorite youtubers smoke and i didnt even know it!,Hutch,shaun0728
yIMfGMVrXDQ,What strain?,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,what is your opinion on the new shit,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Your wrong!  Your a pc player so that means you in pc servers even if you cross play always pc servers do your homework instead of trying to insult a player Base!,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,i figured you as person who would know the difference between a comet an asteroid and meteorites,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,i love you hutcgh aaaaa,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Oh my LORD HUTCH your gameplay has improved soooo much! Awesome stuff man,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Seal clubbing,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Hey Hutch big fan! Just wanted to say that the line "There is still X amount of people still left?" is getting kinda old since it seems to be in every video of yours and others. Big fan.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,if a ps4 player joins you they play on the pc servers  pc players cant play vs ps4 willingly unless you use k/m on ps4  which is super unfair and fun lol,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Anyone see the guy at around 1 minute see hutch impulse then jokingly try to impulse himself with grenades lmao,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Even more evidence of how trash console is compared to PC.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,The beauty of free-to-play games: you can really shit on people hard sometimes,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Solid gameplay. Always knew ps4 is shit for fps crossplay with pc,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,It's not that console players are bad  we just cant build as fast. The new builder pro set up helps with that  though. Even still it slows the game down on console. But some of these players were complete doo doo,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,i can use dat mic bro,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Cx,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,No disrespect to console players. You all are just at a crippling disadvantage going against a mouse and keyboard.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,as a pc player you will never play with just console players,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Placebo?,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,I love Season 4 so far I've gotten double digit kills in multiple matches even got 2 wins day 1 which is rare for me I'm a PS4 player and because i've been playing shoots with controllers my entire life it actually doesn't feel bad for me,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Not the case.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,I really hope I don't get matched with PC players that shit is so annoying  it's such a HUGE disadvantage to almost every aspect of the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,They're so bad lol,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,The cross-platform dedicated servers are pretty easy to stomp out  I'm on Xbox and when I play with guys on PC I find the players easy to kill as well  PC or not,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Hey Hutch! I just want you to know  every time you queue up in squads its cross platform. So even if your whole squad is pc players u will still be in a cross platform lobby. It is like this for Squads and Duos but not Solos.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,RIP Noahs spot,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,It was PC players. You should know that the general level of PS4 players is higher than PC. Of course a guy like Ninja would destroy anyone  i'm talking about the "medium level" of players.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Hecz is a legend,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Why do I get more FPS than hutch but my game is micro stuttery as fuck,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Cross-platform integration is one of the very things I think this game does wrong  console players are at such a monstrous disadvantage it's almost not fun. Keep the races pure  man,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,what were you writing down at the end?,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,I've seen you host nickmercs a couple times  helped me a bunch with my console gameplay! As well as builder pro,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,PS4 players are so bad,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,It works as a mixture. You play with both when you queue with PS4. That last guy you killed was 100% a PS4 player though. Look how he can't keep up after you impulse nade.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,since when do video games release in "seasons"?,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,builder pro is a fairly new controller layout that is on console that levels the playing field alot more. id say PC still is at a small advantage  but builder pro has made it alot easier to build fast on console to keep up,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,It is crossplatform lobbies when you play crossplay. So you will have PC and Ps4 players in the game.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,You were playing on PC servers.  PC players can not play on PS4 servers.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Gaming sex icon.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Console building is complete garbage compared to PC. That alone will be so frustrating to me. As much as i'm excited for the competition aspect  I know ill be getting my ass handed to me more than i'd like.,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Hutch  not trying to be a dickhead and correct you but when you crossplay between PS4 and PC  you will always be playing in a PC lobby. It is impossible for PC players to be placed in a PS4 lobby. just some food for thought  love you videos <3,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Hi Hutch!,Hutch,shaun0728
7iLkS68JheI,Love your shit bro,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,She kinda looks like Miranda,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Haven't watched in a while hutch. Like a couple years. A while back I saw a video of you talking about marrying your best friend. And then a video talking about it the day after. Is this not the same girl? You mention her as your girlfriend not wife. If it's a new girl. What happened to your wife?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Oh no last I saw Hutch was married to a woman named Liz. Time to try and find out what happened.,Hutch,shaun0728

CFRLPBufauY,I can't stop looking at Esme's eyebrows  they look so fresh lol.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch your virtue signaling on Twitter is so embarrassing dude. Your self hating "white progressive" bit is why we have a game show host as a president  Keep  it up.....he'll win in 2020.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,hutch sounds like casey affleck,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch has the best comments section  I'm losing my shit,Hutch,shaun0728

CFRLPBufauY,Hutch  I've been watching you since 2011 approx  I think you are one of the most down to the earth youtubers in the gaming scene. Greetings from Barcelona!!!! Take care of yourself and your people man!!!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,She looks young. Hutch Weinstein. jk,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Your lady is pretty sir hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Missed these Q&As. Looking forward to more to come,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,What's up fellow friend of the pod!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Ay Hutch  i have the same eye color thing. I think its due to the fact that blue eyes aren't actually blue  they just are the blue light that is being scattered instead of having actual pigment,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,She's a keeper!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,You two are adorable. Happy for ya! Oh by the way  if you dont play some damm chess again you will forget everything you learned  old man!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch do you do vape reviews or battery (machine) reviews,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch  how close are you to quitting cigarettes now?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Universal income should happen but with the way the world is  they would rather throw money at the symptoms caused by the huge unemployed rather than find a solution.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,The thumbnail looks like the beginning of a barely 18 fucks an old guy porno,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,I think you guys are great,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,UBI is a fun argument from people who don't understand economics. For a more realistic alternative  try the Negative Income Tax,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,That's a nice poster in the intro,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch clearly has very some very tight skinned balls,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,I can't get zamplebox in Utah...,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,The clearly didn't see the stream or video where we discuss Butterscotch.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Lachie = Lock-ee   Not Lay-ch-ee    CX,Hutch,shaun0728

CFRLPBufauY,She talk too much just answer with a direct answer.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,She needs to learn to look at the lense not herself,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Been waiting for this video for a week.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Spending the first 2 mins of a video you know is going to reach young kids/adults promoting something like vaping is a pretty damn irresponsible sir.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Really enjoyed the video guys  you make a great couple,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch buddy you need to start growing a scattered egg shell mullet.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Ww2 looks different,Hutch,shaun0728

CFRLPBufauY,1:49,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,You two make a great couple,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Universal basic income is inevitable  it will probably be implemented in Europe first and America will follow about a decade or 3 later.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,I like your girlfriend Hutch  you guys are good together.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,in b4 they deal with clashes by fucking.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch maybe you're bisexual  I didn't come to terms with being bi until I was like 20. People can get stuck in that "you're either straight or gay" mentality.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Great vid but who in the hell are these random people trying to determine the longevity of your relationship based on one video? Seems like some people arent happy that hutch is.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,That quabble near the end was great. Also hutch is right.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Did anybody else here a constant ringing in the background ?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch cried on election night lmao.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch is a lucky man.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Where is all your hair Hutch?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Someone has to make one of those emotional montages of hutch from the beginning of his career to where he is now. Just feel like we'vs seen him grow so much,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Loving the Friend of the Pod shirt!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,So good lol,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch is a Friend of the Pod! #PunditIsAnAngel,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,brah  you watching TV while recording? lol,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch  you should watch Idiocracy before you decide to have kids or not.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,whats his insta?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Scrolled too far down into the comments. Pretty sure they gave me Lou Gehrig's Disease,Hutch,shaun0728

CFRLPBufauY,you guys are super  bruh,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,You have hair......,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,This is cute  i loved it. Thanks guys.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,You can tell by the body language that they wont last. He's reaching out to her  while she's very closed off and almost turtled up. The distance between the two is also very telling; he's in the middle and she's about as far on the edge as you can get. She rarely looks at his eyes. I give them six months tops,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,She's cute af man. Glad you're happy,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,When i clash with mah boy  we argue for 5-10 minutes  then we take a break  each sitting shamefully in separate rooms contemplating. About an hour later we come back and sort it out when we've calmed ourselves down.  then we fuck.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Yes!!! Finally,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Esme is adorable  great couple,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Smh at these disrespectful comments  idk why youtubers even bother with uploading videos with family or significant others.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,I love being single and I live for this  but sometimes when I see shit like this  I just feel jelly. Good for you both. Cheers.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Flowky?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,You guys are cute...,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Hutch is a Berniecrat.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,why promote vaping?,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Blue/green eyes aren't coloured by pigment so the colour can change based on the light source/conditions. It's something to do with how light scatters as it passes through the iris  the same way the sky appears blue as light scatters through the atmosphere.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,she's cute! she has very large pupils and it's unique,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,At first I didn't think Esme was very attractive  but now I think she fits Shaun well,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,you guys are awesome!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Oh shit your a friend of the pod?!,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Is it a coincidence your hair started rapidly falling out around the same time you started vaping? Vaping causes male pattern baldness.,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,Chad Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
CFRLPBufauY,I predict another marriage and divorce in the next 2 years!,Hutch,shaun0728

iqDx7iYkjkA,Why ignore gold SCAR?,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,that early kill with the jump grenage was savage,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,0:45 this is why I hate the Pump shotgun  the guy shot straight through Hutch and it did zero damage. The pump is so unreliable ..,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Been watching you for little over a year now! I kind of miss the OMOO gamebattles but I love the stream clip VR because I cant seem to get the time to watch the streams.Keep up the work bud,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,you should try indonesian rummy  you need four player though,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Tilted should be in its own map imo (2nd map with an entirely urban flow rather than the current rural-ish map),Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,If the meteor is hitting Tilted  you can bet that it won't be until the end of the season.  One of the current season's challenges specifically requires Tilted  and they are still selling the Battle Passes.  I do hope they blow it up.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,The thumbnail for this video is ludicrously funny.  Seeing Hutch's face with that afro and the glittery chest plate is just great.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,1:17 Hutch  that was fucking disgusting. He didn't even know what hit him.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Hecz's laugh kills me every time LMAO,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,When you say Rami I assume its the card game?,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,i mean nobody forces anybody to land in tilted  so i think having variety in the map is great so everybody can land where he prefers.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Hutch please make different thumbnails... they honestly look disturbing when you put this face on it Dont want to say that you look like a crackhead on it but its getting there,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,You going live today?,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,stop it hutch....you don't mean it.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,You the best Hutch,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Damn you make it look so easy! And then i play and its basically the equivalent of watching a small but paranoid child randomly smash buttons.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,When he passed up a legendary heavy shotgun for a green pump  that hurt me. I understand why  but it still hurts.,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,Play fortnite with nanners and sark,Hutch,shaun0728
iqDx7iYkjkA,1:17 can I just take a moment to point out how fucking smart this play is? Jesus Hutch.,Hutch,shaun0728

ocGpcrWNxKw,That other dude is actually a pretty entertaining commentator  wouldn't mind more videos or streams with him,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,Hutch  I'm totally in love with this Conro - Lay Low song  which you've used before. It seems to be the only song in this style that Conro has done so far  same with the singer (David Benjamin). Hoping you might know someone else who does music that has this kinda chill techno vibe to it. Please give me some recommendations!  (Actually  I generally love your taste in music  you should just do a music recommendation video).,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,BRO!! That RPG Clutch! GG!!!!,Hutch,shaun0728

ocGpcrWNxKw,Hutch is greedy for drops  and if he spammed less he would kill a lot faster,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,Mavenn's last kill was a "cool guys don't look at explosions" moment!,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,"Congrats on being a dad  you're gonna hate it." Lol,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,Hutch since you are so invested in this game and honestly I can't remember seeing you so so hyped about a game in a long time  do you think that you are gonna completely set it aside for WW2? Cause I sure enjoy this content a lot  so only great things could come from a good balance imo!  Edit: I already like this Mavenn guy  can you start linking people again? It sure made it easier to find people back in the days!,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,I enjoy this series,Hutch,shaun0728
ocGpcrWNxKw,Hutch if you use the scoped ar just aim with the middle of the triangle in the scope rather than the top point like youd use in cod,Hutch,shaun0728
