w7ytaPmUb_g,love your foggy brain it makes for excellent entertainment in my opinion! I have a question though. you always talk about lumi and dewy foundations and i really want that natural glow but i've always been an oily girl. now my skin has become more drygt and my acne is gone and i find myself compleatly LOST! I have no real excperience with creating that natural  healthy glow - what i know is how to do matte and stay matte. I also feel like i still have to set my foundation or else it moves around too much but when i do it gets compleatly matte. what products would you recommend to try? love your channel. you make me feel good about myself!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

SnzVkVe0jcs,Very pretty! Xoxo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
SnzVkVe0jcs,I think you are much more beautiful without make up and you are an exception for me. I thought a lot what about make up made your face look different (and for me  not in a good way) and i think i realised that you have cheeky face and you are highlighting your cheeks by placing the brightening concealer too low  which gives your face  a look as if it has minimal bone structure. + I really like you without crazy false lashes   with your natural beautiful lashes.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
SnzVkVe0jcs,I thank you for embracing your color. I'm also super white and have been considering spray tan but seeing you still look so stunning makes me feel a bit more hopeful for myself!! This looks great! Thank u,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

YgB8AA_HTrA,I feel like IMATS isnt gonna be as busy as it use to be and all the comapnies makign money since they dont really like the yotubers walking around and their supporters wanting to hang out. which doesnt make sense cause companies invite youtubers for a meet and greet but then they dont want to deal with the crowd? doesnet make sense  because most of the time if a yotyuber buys it most likely their supporters will buy it too,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

YgB8AA_HTrA,so when she says stuff like "I left it at my house" or "I couldn't film a real makeup video today so I'm just filming in my beauty space at my house"... it sounds like she has a beauty space for filming that is NOT at her house... what is she referring to? like a studio..? I think that's super cool I'm just wondering because all her videos look like they're filmed in the same space,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

vWAsq-zJMJY,Love you always,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,Foundation  concealer  powder  and then you do a minimal face on top on that. Doing your normal foundation routine makes your skin look better  b/c everything's even and all in 1 color. DUH!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

vWAsq-zJMJY,do you have a video using the Chanel Soleil de chanel cream bronzer??? i thought it was your video i had seen in the past using it!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,Reading these negative comments I hurt for Jaclyn. Yes she is a public figure but really guys she is living her life how it makes HER happy. i just never really understood why people literally get angry about this type of stuff. It's not affecting YOUR life and their not your lips. Why must miserable people always try and throw shade on the people who SHINE!? Jaclyn is beautiful inside and out  she is living her life to the fullest! I'm pretty sure she worked her tail off to get where she is today. Some of you clearly are just jealous and that's understandable but that does not give yous a right to to say the mean things you say. It says a lot when you have such hate for a beautiful person yet your on her Channel  watching her videos  and even take the time to scroll down and write a paragraph about HER. Stay awesome and bubbly Jaclyn!*,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,you kinda look like Kaitlyn Bristowe from the Bachelorette :) Gorgeous girl.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

vWAsq-zJMJY,Just started following you  there are so many haters on here  WTF? I think your lips look gorg and really fit your face shape! Love this look. Xo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,I would like to get my lips don. What do you recomend. Any good places in NY. Thank you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,you are hilarious  love all the glow  inside and outside girl,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,To be honest I'm not digging the intense highlighter trend. I like a subtle highlight with a very light hand... like to the affect of when you've been outside for a bit and your skin gets a natural sheen. A lot of people seems to love this though  so to each their own I suppose.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,Omg I love this look,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,@jaclynhill Your videos are so fun to watch. What I like about you is that you are naturally funny. It never looks like you are trying. It's really what got me hooked to your videos.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vWAsq-zJMJY,you are more beautiful without make up  really... you don't need make up,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I am so in love with you and your videos and you have helped me so much in coming to terms with my own anxiety and depression and how i manage it on a daily and for that I love you even more and thank you xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

XV9ttnZ4Apg,You look like Snow White!! Just so beautiful without makeup :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,You literally inspire me sooooo much!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I wish you saw yourself the way we see you  because you're so damn naturally beautiful and you don't even need a quarter of the makeup you normally wear. I know that it's more of a creative/artistic thing when you wear makeup  but you're so stunning without it :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Did anyone else who watched the video think that Kim was purposely being stuck up towards Jaclyn because that's probably her biggest competition?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,love you jaclyn  your personality is just gorgeous. Don't understand why people are so mean to you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,With over 14 000 comments I know this is a shot in the dark but I feel the need to write this..I knew of you but never watched your videos or took the time to see what you are all about.. BUT Last night your video came up on my suggestion list so I watched a few videos and the video of you and your best friend got me hooked. I love how you are super down to earth and have an amazing personality. People take youtube too seriously now which takes away the personal connection but you arent. You want people to see you for whom you are whether they like it or not and that's bad ass lol anyways the reason I'm writing this comment is because of your home experience (10:30). God is amazing and works in mysterious ways. My fiance and I had the exact same experience so id like to share it with you. We searched and searched for a home in San Antonio (well i searched and he gave me his input lol) but every house tour was a drag.. either the images didn't match up with the house or they just weren't what we were looking for. we put in a couple applications and got denied and at that point I was hopeless and I felt like giving up. Then one Sunday I got up and texted my realtor and said I know its last minute but can we look at houses today and she just picked random houses that we could possibly see last minute. I got into my truck and I felt God tell me "Today is the day  you have been patient and now youll come across your home" I felt it to the core and it shook me!! The first house we drove up to I looked at my realtor and said this is the house.. I know it this is it and i then explained to her my experience with God that morning(this was my first true connection/experience like this with God). We viewed other homes but I knew that the first one we saw in the day was the house. Now its been a few months in the house and we love it.. It is truly home for us. I appreicate you telling your story in your video because people dont know the power of God. People have forgotten about God or just dont know much about him so seeing and hearing you talking about your experience with God on your social platform with the huge following you have warms my heart. Thank you for living for God and by God. You have many many more blessings coming your way and as for your husband God is taking care of him and he will be healthy and im sure of it. Continue your great work and keep sharing that beautiful personality.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,she legit annoyed her soooo much she was like : kim girllll and kims face is just like : bitch i dont care for your fuckingg morphe blender or foundation just let me talk u mouthy bish y u so hiperactive,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I love this makeup look! I really like it when you do GRWM videos,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I feel terrible how mean some people were towards you. If they only knew how much pressure was placed on you  I probably would have rambled too. Your a sweet girl and you seem like your kind and try to always do your best.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Have you heard of Dressember? You should definitely look it up and consider doing it one year. You could raise so much money for human trafficking. I was an advocate this previous year and it was an amazing experience. The style challenge of wearing a dress every day kept it fun and interesting. They are a great organization one of their grant partners is A21!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Your personality is beautiful! Watching your video right now brightened my day. I pray God continues to bless you and your family! <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,When's closing?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I absolutely love these types of videos! The laid back look is my jam,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,don't listen to all the negativity. people don't determine your greatness. let what you do always be what you want not other peoples vision of what it should be.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,You are so gorg!! My inspo xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,WHITE LIGHTS - TOO BRIGHT!!! Can you fix your lighting to where you look more normal in color instead of faded out bright white. It's so bright that it blurs out all the true colors and just makes everything including you look casper white. The lighting makes it to where you're unable to tell the true colors of the makeup. The foundation looks like a pastey white/pink blur.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,what is that cream contour that you were using in this video??? Interested!! lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Omg  you look amazing without makeup :o,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Nice!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,I truly love you now...just found you not long ago but when you talk about God as perspective I just totally fell in love with ya,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

XV9ttnZ4Apg,i love these videos so much,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Omg I had no idea John had een seizure (or however you write that). I know I am late watching this video  and now I wish I did it before... Life will only get better from this point,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Congrats,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,what products are used in this videos?!  mostly want to know foundation and cream bronzer !!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Kim did a video where she said she didn't feel Jaclyn wss being rude  Kim was aware that you were both nervous & you were given the duty off carrying the conversation which obviously would make ANNNNNYONE nervous!  Get real people. If you ever filmed with Kim I'm sure you'd not act like yourself either!  Damn haters  the more fame you get the more hate you get its crazy.  Can no one be happy for anyone?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Sooooooo glad you didn't delete your YouTube! I don't know what I'd do without you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,What is name of the cream bronzer you applied?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,What was the bronzer (looked like a cream?) she used here?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,It's crazy the negativity I've seen around your video with Kim. Funny how easily people can criticize when they know nothing of what went on behind the scenes. Congrats on your continued success though girl you slayyy <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Jaclyn I love your videos but it would be super helpful if you would write all the products you use and talk about in the description box...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Your smile is so beautiful!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Oh my gosh even with no makeup Jaclyn is a goddess.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

XV9ttnZ4Apg,Pretty af with and without makeup,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Love this and your earrings are so cute!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Jaclyn I remember the video when you celebrated your 2 million subscribers. Now look at you.  You were a role model for me in the sense of. Becoming a business owner. Unfortunately getting involved with a man that abandoned me after ten years getting into a car accident with a broken hand and no vehicle I can't even trAvel the two hours to go back tour county to file for support . He wants to se me in pain and he won I want to say best of luck and I'm going to be with Jesus now.  God Bless you and you'd be great mom...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

XV9ttnZ4Apg,I love how honest and raw you are in this video (in general) - Don't trip about that video...we all know the you! <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,You disable the video with Kim for the comments. It wasn't awkward I just feel like you kept talking over her and that's slightly disrespectful. When you collaborate the point is not to try to over do the other person or be the center but your constant chatter was.... interesting,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Kim was being a bitch bc Jaclyn is prettier and more talented,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XV9ttnZ4Apg,Hey sweetheart ! Thank you for being you! You give me so much strength in believing in myself.! Your 1 of my inspirations here on youtube! Keep up the good work  don't pay attention to what the people are saying they don't know what you go thru! Just a quick question? How did you gave yourself the boost to film and truly show yourself on camera and dealing with down moment?! May God bless you xoxo!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

She has put me to shame  and I'm not ashamed to say it lol!! Learning how to do her makeup and YouTube videos have made her self esteem improve so much!! I was hoping you would watch one of her videos  and give her some constructive criticism on how to improve her makeup and her videos better!! It would mean so much to her  and to me!! I know by getting you to watch her video it would help her even more with her self esteem!! Thank you for being one of my daughters heroes  and just taking the time to read my comments. God bless you!!  https://youtu.be/qXHxkAGiiV0,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

rtG2Y0G-a8g,great video and one day i will own champagne pop. Dreams come true. xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
rtG2Y0G-a8g,I'm crying because I never thought I would be able to afford Champagne Pop but my boyfriend and I talked about me buying it as a product for me to have to look at knowing I am working towards my goal and that it is possible. But we are dancers saving to move to LA in a few months and I can't afford the highlight right now. Becca's website was having a 50% off sale on the creme so I figured I would buy it in the poured creme version so I could still have it as a reminder of working towards my goals and wearing it on my cheeks to give me confidence in myself when auditioning and going out to teach workshops. I am crying because I finally bought it and I am going to have it in my hands. you are a huge inspiration to me and a huge part of who keeps me going everyday and makes me realize I can follow my dreams and have it all and it is possible. I also have really bad anxiety and I have such a hard time coping with it recently and my derealization is awful and I am rambling so much but I can't tell you how much your videos help me when I can't function on really bad anxiety days. I finally will own champagne pop as a reminder that it will all be okay and dreams are possible. I love you Jaclyn. Thank you for everything.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

So many young women and men are able to relate with you on so many issues. You give so many of us hope for a brighter future as long as we stay positive while moving forward and working hard. 2016 was not easy for a lot of people  but ultimately these bumps in the road help us pave a path of success. Ive learned so much from you in the last year and a half that I just wanted to thank you for every word of encouragement you've shared. I don't need you to acknowledge this but I just really want you to read these words so you understand how important you are to so many people. I pray that you and Jon remain healthy and continue moving up in your relationship and successes. Thank you so much for all of your positive words and advise.

5yLaAsesumY,The original Jaclyn hill palette,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Does she ever NOT put liner all the way around her eye?.... makes them look small.. not a good look,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,*This Looks Exactly likethe palette she made*,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This is very similar to the Jaclyn hill palette with Morphe  I just realized that.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Look how different her lips and nose look,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,look how tiny her lips are! before her lip injections,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,You look so different now,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Oh hey! It's your morphe palette!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,wheres this makeup tutorial at thoooo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Watching this in 2017  these shadows remind me of the Jaclyn Hill palette!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,I'm guessing she already had an idea of what her palette was going to be so she found dupes of her morphe colors just to see how the feedback was.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Me seeing the thumbnail;  Mmmm Jaclyn I see what u did there guirrrrllll xo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,am I the only one that noticed this looks almost identical to her palette? LOL,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,These shadows must have been your inspiration to your Morphe collaboration.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,She talks way too fast  I had to check if the speed was on Normal or 1.5x  lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,anybody notice that this looks extremely similar to her palette? she just made her go to palette and saved us the trouble of trying to recreate it lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Does anyone know what eyeshadow she was wearing in this video?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This is like the same as the palette she made with Morphe,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,is this basically her Morphe collab pallet,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,You made  your palette looks just the same as yours,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Anyone notice that these shades are super similar to her Jaclyn Hill Morphe palette??,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Oh shoot i just came Back to watch this video and realized how much better you look with your lips done,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Looks a lot like the morphe palette,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,I'm seeing some huge similarities to the Jaclyn Hill x Morphe palette. This must have been the inspiration. Cool!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This doesnt really matter but its the first video of yours that I have watched and I noticed that you rush yourself and talk really face. If I can suggest that you take your time and go at your own pace instead of speeding up so much  that would be great. I have a few reason I am suggesting this. 1. After a long day at work I do not wish to be hyped up and get my adrenaline running so I can keep up with what you are saying 2. I have brain damage so it really is much harder for me to concentrate on what you are saying and try to keep up with you at the say time.   I think that if your subscribers love you  they don't mind watching you for a bit longer just cause you slow things down. Maybe you can ask in your next video on their opinion? I have to say  this is one reason why I am swaying on subscribing to you. Of course it isn't a big deal ad maybe you are just a hyper and uppity person on a regular basis full of enthusiastically and pure excitement. If this is the case  never change who you are. I am simply suggesting this so it is easier to watch your videos so I can subscribe. Have a very nice day.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Lol her morphe palette is actually so similar,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,...doesn't think look just like her Morphe palette????,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This looks similar to your Morphe palette at first glance!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,just realized. similar to your palette!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This strangely reminds me of the Morphe Jaclyn Hill palette...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Please do a makeup look using dragonfly! <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,You probably won't even see this comment but what the hell...I'm gonna try anyways..   I've been a subscriber for a verrryyyy long time now and I can honestly say you and Kathleen lights are my favorite youtubers... but I feel like you have changed. And I already know what you're thinking oh god another person telling me this bullshit..but I'm talking about the person we see on YouTube. I get you have made millions of dollars and are very well off and love to use high end brands now..but for an average consumer things like that aren't practical. Yaknow? And I know you know because you used to be one of those girls. I also notice that the only affordable brand you use frequently is morphe and idk if that's because a large amount of ur income comes from them or if you just genuinely love those products? But I wish other brands would be incorporated as well like actual drugstore or color pop shadows yaknow things like that. Not just morphe morphe morphe. I really do love you and I'm so happy for you and all your success...I've bought all your collabs and will continue to do so...I just hope you bring back the old Jaclyn in the sense of being on a budget and not NEEDING all the lavish things. At least not all the time because it can make people feel bad or less than about what they have. I hope you see what I'm saying because it's just a thought I had .,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Kinda looks like your palette from morphe!!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,I'm surprised makeup geek corrupt wasn't in there,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,To all the people who listed the eyeshadow names I just went to say a huge thank you that is dedication and just proves how nice you are to take time out of your life to help others x,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This Z palette reminds me so much of your JaclynxMorphe palette ! Who needs to buy all these single eye shadows when they can just buy your palette!? #Genius,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,Is this only me or this custom pallet is way too similar to her morphe pallet???,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,this is literally the pallet you made with morphe lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This is obviously very similar to her Morphe palette BUT isn't that an amazing thing?? She was able to take her favorites from these awesome brands and put her own spin on it. How cool is that? There is room for everyone in the makeup world. What a huge compliment to Makeup Geek  ABH & MAC that someone would love their makeup so much it would inspire then to create their own version.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This Palette looks a lot like her new Morphe palette,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,This looks sooo much like the Jacklyn Hill pallete!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,does anyone else noticed how her new morphe palette is so similar to this palette? it's so cool how she made her own palette with a new formula,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,A lot of those colors she put in her morphe palette awwww,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,It's crazy how this is so similar to her Morphe palette haha,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

5yLaAsesumY,Its amazing how similar this is to your Morphe Palette!! Love having a palette like yours!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,oh my gosh now that I'm watching this I can see the resemblance to her new morphe pallet its like she was giving us a sneak peak and we didn't even know!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,*adds to cart*,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,THE MORPHE X JACLYN HILL PALETTE BEFORE IT WAS THE MORPHE Z JACYLN HILL PALETTE !!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
5yLaAsesumY,<3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

hLC-SfgfHbk,I am honestly in love with your videos. I follow your snapchat and instagram too and it's just so helpful and inspiring to see someone tell the DOWN AND DIRTY details of every product. I cannot tell you how much you have influenced my life for the better! I never used to get into really "Youtube bloggers" or whatever but you just give real life  applicable advice and I'm honestly obsessed with you. I'm a bit of an impulse buyer/a girl who will watch your videos and just order everything you have laid out in these videos. Not to get all emotional but I literally think we were separated at birth with how much our personalities and tastes are the same :-') I know you've already made a ton of "What's in my bag?" Or "How I organize my stuff" videos but I would love to see more of those.   Thanks for the constant online support and ideas  keep doing you girl. Life can get rough believe me  I know but you conquer every situation you're in and i'm lucky to have found a blogger that I can relate to so much.  Xoxo  Han! <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

XvH2ukztRzs,this is everything!!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XvH2ukztRzs,But how do you make it (regarding the baking part)so it doesn't look too 'powdery'  if that makes sense? It seems like everyone else just brushes off the excess & looks flawless  but if I try that it just looks like I have powder sitting on my face! Setting spray helps a little  but it always looks powdery still on me.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XvH2ukztRzs,I absolutely love Translucent powder by Avon  and it's also easier to use: no mess when you put it in the lid,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
XvH2ukztRzs,Thank you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

First symptom he was laughing without reason when I was talking to him on the road and I remember I told him he was crazy and he pissed me off... But he was already started a seizure.  I never had to deal with this kind of things so it was traumatizing for me.  Doctors found nothing to explain his seizure... 2 weeks later he seizured on the bed next to me a very nightmare... And he can't remember anything.... During a while I couldn't sleep next to him I was to traumatized... Now he his on medecin for the rest of his life.... It's hard for him and for me.  He forget a lot of things because of the pills but if he don't take them he seizure again... Life is so weird we don't know why this happened....,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

miIr7NmKA0g,My best friend and me just want to be around you. Learn from you  and laugh together! Everyone is going have people who are JEALOUS  they are totally jealous because they don't have what you have. People always want to bring people down to their level.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
miIr7NmKA0g,My freshman year in high school  I was talking with friends after school and right there in front of the main office i started seizing  I thanks god everyday that one of my best friends caught me. I could have hit the concrete floor. I was 15  and to this day it was one of the scariest moments to "wake up" and not have any idea what's happening or what day it is. I can understand how scary it must have been.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
miIr7NmKA0g,Jaclyn I just need to say that this video meant so much to me. My husband also randomly developed seizures also. We went through all the test and scans and anything you could think of and everything came came back normal. We struggled with it for about a half a year. He kept having seizures about every 3 months until we could finally get a seizure medicine that would work. It was so hard to let him have a second to himself because I was always so scared that he would have a seizure and I wasn't going to be there. Any weird noises I heard or if anything fell I instantly thought that he was having one and my heart would just stop. But the overtime we have finally realized like we can deal with it  and everything is going to be okay. But for the longest time it was just so scary. So I'm very encouraged to hear you say that no matter what we're going to get through it because that's what I kept trying to tell myself and tell him through the whole thing. And I have to say that the first time it happened I was there  I felt the exact same way you describe it. It was like  the life in his eyes just left and there was only fear and terror and I just I thought he was going to die. I never witnessed a seizure before and I had no idea what was happening. It really was just the scariest thing I've ever been through. So I really appreciate you sharing this very scary and intimate moment with me. It really does encourage me so much. Also on another note you are so gorgeous and I'm so glad that you've decided to just ignore and just not care about what all these haters have to say. I love all of your videos I've been watching you for a while and you are such an inspiration and I hope you will continue to bring joy to people the way you do with your videos and just being your genuine self. Also definitely getting your eyeshadow palette because for real like are you serious it's the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen! And I love your dark hair it's so suits your skin and your features and it's beautiful.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

miIr7NmKA0g,Ever sinced i got diagnosed with a seizure disorder/epilepsy ive seen and hear so many people having seizures and i used to hesr nothing about anyone ik of wether social media or personal except one from dance camp from loosing her  electrolytes from sweating so much but from never hearing of it and now hearing or seeing post about peoole having them its sooooo weird. But idk if they told you if he ever has another one turn him on his right side because something about so the fluids can drain from the heart is what i was told. But i now have to take some medicine for the rest of my life and my old case manager had me order a medical bracelet/dog chain so if it ever happens or anything they can see that.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

tifRNT4afbg,HOLY SHIT  ILY. I've been trying to binge all your videos to catch up with you/your journey. I think watching your videos in reverse is so inspiring. I've never done it before BUT I just watched your closet tour  and now I'm watching this. Life is one crazy roller coaster. You are one hell of a human. I've never felt so much emotion from anyone on social media and I can't stop listening to you. When I watch your videos  especially your older videos  all my anxiety goes away from where I'm at in life/worrying about the unknown. I am turning 24 in May  & I just graduated college and got my cosmetology license. Venturing out into the career field I easily I doubt myself at least once a day  and I could list a thousand reasons why I think negatively (which after wathcing this  I know you know how that feels). But NO WONDER you won American Influencer. Put so much perspective into life/minds. Thank you for being you. Your past  present and future influences people. I don't think you know how incredible of a person you have to be to have that happen.  P.s you are my glass of wine and my "ahh" moment at the end of the day haha.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

I was barely starting to really get into makeup  so I decided I'd find you to see what you're all about.

MG-2MhZya74,Actl i have no idea why people are focusing more on how "she is different than usual" or the "endorsing with certain brands too much" - why isn't there as much people complimenting how much efforts she took to explain every step of what she did in her makeup tutorials? She does it like 95% of her tutorials and people choose to overlook it most of the time...?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MG-2MhZya74,The KatVonD is just like the shape tape ! except has fuller coverage. shade range is amazing ! I got Neutral 9 shade  as I like a mix of golden and pink for under the eyes. She has a pure white shade so that would be good for mixing concealors and shadow base. It has Hydrating claims as welll  its a Hybrid of UD & Born this way ! Just work quick cus its a cream basicallly so needs to be blended and set . Her powder is amazing too ! not drying  at all ! Perfect !,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MG-2MhZya74,So talented and so beautiful x,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MG-2MhZya74,Jaclyn I inspire the beauty and knowledge God gifted you. I have literately have bought almost everything I've watched you use in most all of your tutorials seriously my extra bedroom looks like a mini Sephora store  sadly half of it I've never used however have it if I ever need it. Some items we must buy seasonal as I've made three more orders this month. My husband will never understand but oh well :) I don't follow or have any social media but Facebook as I follow you and a couple more if you'd send me a message through FB. I am still learning and I have almost every shadow pallet out there. My latest is the Anastasia Modern Renaissance Palette. I would like to ask you when you have time to do a full tutorial on full coverage foundation as I use/have EL double wear  KVD  Dior forever and Elizabeth Arden flawless pump which just ordered the same color today from Dillard's in the EA Ceramide Ultra Lift and Firm SPF 15 foundations along with the UD concealer in Naked skin weightless complete coverage in "warm nude" along with Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat in #2 Luminous Ivory- Girls this is one of the best I own  Sephora has a deal on this for 60.00 comes with a pink bag  lipstick  full size Baby Doll black mascara. The Yves concealer alone normally runs around 45.00 but its worth every penny. Settings powders I have or have not used yet are MUF HD   Laura Mercier standard size and just bought the LM white secreting brightening powder. Yes I do own a lot and that's just a few :( I have several face and eye primers and I swear by the Nars pro-time smudge proof base and the EA at Dillard's face primer over any face primer called Visible difference Good Morning. With all of this being said of some I do own I would like to ask when you have time if you would send me a message through Facebook if you could make a full tutorial using some of the brands I do have. Most of all using the ABH modern pallet using the "burnt orange" as the translucent powder adding the Realgar  Venetian red  love letter and maybe the darker brown in the pallet on the outer V of the lid with using one of the golds for the center of the eyelid and corner of the eyes. I am looking for a med/light smokey halo effect. I have tried this look so many times and can't get it right. I have also tried using the Dior 621 Mirror shimmering gold with the aqua seal  not working and just ordered the single of the Dior Festive Gold Touch. I am still learning and only through you! If and when you have time please message me through my Facebook as I am following you as always. You are a beautiful lady <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MG-2MhZya74,PLEASE DO A KIDS MAKEUP TUTORIA!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

bXBAmbnsWQc,What was the point to put a red base  cover it with dark red shadow  and then concealer and gold eye shadow and glitter? Is it 100 layers of makeup? It looks like anti-tutorial-things that you should avoid.I don't usually post mean comments  but because you're extra annoying-I'm going to say it- you look like a mannequin.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

uB_Kx6T3wq4,Her eye color is so gorgeous. I'm OBSESSED :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
uB_Kx6T3wq4,I personally think that if you used just a few colors in the crease & the lid  the look would look the same. This complicates things. My opinion.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
uB_Kx6T3wq4,I love you so much and i really wish you would upload more! You barely upload and it sucks,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
uB_Kx6T3wq4,When she put the purple on her lid she made a dusky sky flipped over,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

_QNFwSV_8-w,this video was awesome. can you also do a tutorial for dark skinned/black women?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
_QNFwSV_8-w,I wish Jackie was on YouTube because she would add more variety with her skin type. I feel like all of the makeup artists who are as hardcore as Jaclyn Hill all have more dry skin. I have more oily combination skin so I have to kind of hunt for products on my own. It's so hard to find makeup what works for more oily skin. I know Jackie is oily and I could just use the products used in the video but Jaclyn was saying how her face took so much product. That really stinks.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
_QNFwSV_8-w,YOU'RE THE BEST! Omggggg,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

_QNFwSV_8-w,Would love to see a eyebrow tutorial on Jackie. I have brows similar to hers.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
_QNFwSV_8-w,Could you do a bridal look on Jackie?? I'd love to see what you would do for her!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
_QNFwSV_8-w,19:34 Jaclyn Hill can i have your voice?! oh my god that was amazing!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

fmAeK3mNJMg,@jaclynhill I have been going crazy for the LONGEST time since you even mentioned this giveaway. I emailed you a million times. When I found out I could finally enter  I went crazy excited. Then I read your steps.. Step 1. DONE. Step 2. DONE. Step 3. ... I try to think.. What friends can I tag.. I think again.. Then I find myself getting bad anxiety and feeling alone because I realize that I have no friends. So I considered tagging my twin 5 times because she is not only my twin  but she is my best friend. I've already told her about you a million times. So how about we change the rules for once and not go based on getting more fans  but choosing someone who knows your true and genuine self. One who not only watched every video the moment it notify a me  but one who looks up to and your everyday struggle because you help me get through my days of feeling hope. I'll be bummed if I don't get picked  but I wouldn't mind because just being able to watch your videos are a blessing! Love you Jaclyn since day one!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Bo_9aH7_KOM,You are amazing  Jaclyn!!!!!!;,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I know this video is quite old  but I came upon it searching for a look on the Ombre Rouge palette I was looking to buy because of the BECCA sale and I wasn't sure if I should. I watched  and then I got to the end where you talked about Paris. I usually watch videos on my TV using my Roku  but I hopped on here to say a few things.   First  you said "I know this is just a beauty channel " and I felt like you were discounting your own words just because your channel is about makeup. No. When you do this  you are comforting people and using your large platform to speak to people who might be hurting  or people here in the states who are impacted by events such as these. I feel that people with these platforms *should* be responsible with them and express these things. So  just talk to us all and don't apologize or discount your own feelings and actions just because your channel is about something specific.   Second  just cry  honey. There is no need to fan your face or hold the tears back just because you're on camera. You're 3-dimensional and human  and that's how you feel so just let it out. You might even touch someone but letting the tears be seen.   Anyway  you probably won't see this because you have so many commenters and this is an old video  but I thought I would try and say it to you  anyway.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Love you Jaclyn I love watching your videos. They help me so much doing my own makeup!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I miss your hair this color! You do you  Boo!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I know i am late on this video. But Jaclyn  you and Jon are such sweet people to think of the ones who were having such a difficult time in Paris that's so sweet to care about those people. It truly shows that even that one girl tweeting appreciates the prayers and thoughts of those victims and people affected by that awful day. Keep being the sweet girl you are. i love your channel btw!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Bo_9aH7_KOM,Ur the best beauty vlogger of all time! Playful yet informative and awesome!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,which taste kabuki brush are you using? i ve been crazy looking for it,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Like... I understand Paris needs support but this isn't such a fucking sudden thing  terror  more specifically islam-extremist terror is happening all around the world. That girl couldn't leave the house? Guess what  she wasn't the first one. In my fucking city in Israel a few years back a missile that was sent from gaza hit a building leaving nothing  ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING  but the safety room  in which thankfully the apartment owner lived. In another time  the entire school had to go into our bunker-type safety room that every building here must have and wait there until it was "safe" to come out  because it's not ever really safe. Another time  the telephone lines crashed from too many calls being made in an attack. And I live in the area where all this is very very mild. There are areas where people cannot leave their safety room  where they have seconds to get to it before a missile hits where people dying is A FUCKING NORMAL THING. Paris isn't the first.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Love love love your videos!! They're so helpful!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I totally teared up with you at the end. With everything bad and tragic going on in the world today  you are like bubbly breath of fresh air and love!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I know you get told this only the daily  and my one comment is going to blend into the thousands of others that you receive  but you are so beautiful inside and out! Never stop spreading your goodness and love <3 xoxo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Jaclyn - I am good at putting the eyelashes ON but the taking off part is what I struggle with. Can we get a video showing how you take off your lashes (do you re-use them?) and how you ensure you don't hurt your own lashes?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Youre so beautiful  and not only on the outside. I appreciate a woman who cares so much the way I do  I can relate so much <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Bo_9aH7_KOM,Can you pleaseeeee make a hair care video like how you got your hair color  I've been dying to get the exact hair color you have but no one else has really made a tutorial or made a video of how to take care of the color and prevent your hair from getting damaged. I really wanna know what to expect if I end up going red I know everyone's hair type is different but it'll be nice to know the process you went through,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,my last name is hill,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,i remembered watching this video after the Orlando shooting happened and re-watched it as a pick-me-up. it worked. You're amazing   Jaclyn  and your positivity is what is keeping the world sane. <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Bo_9aH7_KOM,Hi Jaclyn! I'm a huge fan of yours. Can you do a very simple and basic everyday makeup look for beginners? I just got my first eye shadow palette last week along with concealer  can you do a simple tutorial for  year 10 students and if you don't know what year ten is its just 10th grade #asianstuff please please please read my comment,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Bo_9aH7_KOM,hey Jaclyn! super random comment but these shades that are in the Becca Ombre Rouge palette say that they are matte on Sephora's site  but on you they look super satiny and almost glowy. What would you describe them as?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Jaclyn  how about a face mask tutorial,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,I'm not sure I understand your definition of "feminine" here  but okay. Not the best intro to your channel  it's a little troubling to see gender pronouns attached to makeup period. But anyway. Great look though!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
Bo_9aH7_KOM,Why am the ONLY woman that an inner corner highlight looks awful on? It's frustrating bc it's so beautiful on ppl.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

cynvzdJ9knw,I love you! your funny and personable in your chit chat tutorials. you do make up soooo well and awesome i have learned so much about how to apply makeup from you. anything you recommend i go get bc i have dry skin like you and whatever i get ALWAYS works great for my skin. your amazing love you!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,hi! how come you didn't use translucent powder to set the face for the whole day? in your other videos you said it is very important to bake the face. Also if you use the translucent powder after the banana under eye powder  does it get rid of it because of the baking process?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,anyone else feel like in 3:33 she whips that brush outta nowhere?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

cynvzdJ9knw,I love youuuuu,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Hey Jaclyn I really wanted to know what soaps and creams you use for your face that looks very smooth and nice,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,I need a easy peasy "how to apply false lashes",Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,What is the eyeliner called that she wanted to use but couldn't because she didn't have a sharpener? I could not understand what she said,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Okay but literally this is so true. I started wearing falsies and now I feel so bald when I don't wear them,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Thanks for letting me feel OK not wearing falsies. I thought I was the only one! I just can't do it well  and we all know what it looks like when it all goes wrong.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Please name all your brushes,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,I actually don't wear false lashes  i love my lashes as they are and one coat of mascara makes them fuller :) I actually love that you have done this type of video as this is what i look for in tutorials  rather than full on glam. Plus this is the type of look i probably wear the most  up early out the door for work lol. I really want to try the Anastasia brow definer/brow wiz  heard so much about those. I currently use the maybelline brow satin and that works fine for me especially when my brows have been waxed  shaped and tinted :)Haha  thats o me when i use brushes the fine hairs cling to my skin and you can feel it tickling your face...so annoying lmao!! I have the too faced better than sex mascara in sample versions only and is till haven't tried it  you totally just reminded me lol. This look is like how i do most of my everyday makeup apart from blush im not so keen on blushes at the moment x,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,I know I'm late to the Jaclyn party and that this is an old video  but why do you sometimes do your face makeup before the eyes and sometimes you do it after your eyes? Just wondering  love your vids!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,I love all the tips and looks you do but can you do a to tutorial on aged skin. I just tired 40 and I've noticed that I can't do highlights on the top of my cheeks anymore because it shows more of my flaws. I have really good skin and a young looking face but that step just really ages me. Is there anything or any product out there or any tip that I can use instead?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,U and Nikkie tutorials should do a collab she loves a lot of things that u do,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Does she have a hickey?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,A. OMG I freakin love you  your videos and you crack me up :-) .....B.   $115 for a brush...  that's CRAY,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

cynvzdJ9knw,I love when you do videos like this  I wish you would do more of them. I like how you are teaching us tips and tricks  and how to use each product  and brush. This was one of the first videos I watched of you when I first really started getting into makeup (obsessed!!) and you really taught me A LOT! So  thank you for that. Keep it goin' gurl!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,I'm addicted to your tutorials! and I'm a professional make up artist :-),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Jaclyn i hate that i can't write to you privately  commenting anywhere on social media is like an open invitation for people to chime in whatever i would like to say to YOU.  So I will try to keep this short and hope you have a chance to read it.  I started watching make up tutorials on Youtube maybe about a year ago and fell in love with the art of it all.  Although your videos were not the first I came across  yours were the ones that captivated me the most.  I know you will make us all proud with whatever you have been working on all this time  I know this because you're absolutely amazing and I trust your judgement and character.  With all the hate you receive I am so impressed with the way you are able to spread so much love.  So many people try to play it off like they're content with the amount of hate they receive on social media and claim that it does not effect them.  I truly admire the fact that you allow your feelings to seep through sometimes its very genuine and respectable.  I love you and your videos and i really hope you're able to get back to the place you want to be as far as Youtube is concerned.  xo -Nicole,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
cynvzdJ9knw,Thank you for this tutorial! I didnt know using a damp beauty blender for concealer on your undereye could do so much for how it looks and stays!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

I think it's cause her voice is one toned so it just blurs into one run on sentence ..also when she's showing the  products she's going to use why does she hold them touching her face or her right eye  she's done it with almost every bottled or tubed product she's used.. I know that it's a petty observation but it's just odd.. it's almost like she thinks it's like cutesy or something.. idk just my totally unneeded two cents,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

a271Po9lZ4w,Has Diana fountain got a new number now because I know it's from 2 years ago and my text failed to send. I'm from the uk  so I do I need to add extra digits to be recognisable? Xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,Please do an update!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,Skincare is incredibly personal and I can't believe people are getting angry over that. No one's skin is the same  if drug store doesn't work you keep moving on until you find what works for you. Clearly that is what Jaclyn did  if you need to do it you should do it too. If drugstore works for you keep using it  but not everyone can. Esspecially if you have dry skin because products that dry your skin out even more can cause big problems with sensitivity down the line.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

a271Po9lZ4w,I really love your videos but this video is my least fav. These products are not realistic for normal hard working people. I feel that you are promoting these products to benefit yourself and not your viewers. This is the reason you have received so many negative reviews. People want realistic products that are affordable and easy to get.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,I'm very into makeup  but I'm having a hard time finding a good skin care routine  I break out a lot and I don't know what good foundation to use because I'm very oily. HELLLLPPPPP!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

a271Po9lZ4w,@JaclynHill I'm new to skincare routines and ran into the problem where I will only wear makeup for the first half of the day  but then I don't know how to approach my skin washing routine. Do I have to wash my face 3 times on those days? I feel that is too much because even washing my face twice a day is rough for my skin. Do you have to do your night time skin care routine early on those days where you only want makeup on your skin in the morning?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,What website can I buy these from?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,Please do an updated skincare routine!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

a271Po9lZ4w,Don't you use Clarisonic mia 2 anymore??,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,i love and use the purity cleanser too! if y'all haven't heard of Nerium  you need to check it out!! Whole system in one bottle. It's my ride or die so much I sell it now!!

a271Po9lZ4w,Hi jaclyn! I notice you no longer use the clarisonic cleaning brush. Why? I just saw your review from 2013 because I've been thinking about getting it  but then i saw this skincare routine and noticed you didn't mentioned it  and you cleaned your face with just your hands like you said it wasn't recommended on that review video because we don't clean as much with our hands than with the brush. I was just wondering  did it no longer worked for you  or did you find something different?  I noticed other subscribers are wondering the same thing  if the brush is life changing for your skin  why no longer use it  or probably you just didn't mentioned it? I hope you see this and hopefully respond. Thanks!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,she looks sooooo young without makeup on.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a271Po9lZ4w,Hot damn  her daily skincare products cost almost as much as my monthly rent!

IlMcf3x_2tQ,I agree with Wayne goss when he says this really highlighted look has to die down. Too much highlighter looks bad. A little gives off such a nice and sweet subtle glow. Like he says   so much highlighter on the tip of the nose looks silly  we don't even glow there naturally. Everyone should watch his video on highlighting. Very informative from an ACTUAL Licensed makeup artist  I also went to beauty school and am a licensed make up artist.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

4LZXQQNUATw,U r so cringy LOL,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
4LZXQQNUATw,I assume that we can use any colors we want using that technique. Thank you Jaclyn,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
4LZXQQNUATw,First off  Beautiful look  beautiful girl. But honestly I personally did not find this look "easy"...lots of steps and if I attempted it  eyeshadow would get all over my face  and I feel like you have to constantly wash your eyeshadow brushes to keep them clean for each step. Also she talked way too fast and loud and erratically for me to follow each step. It DID overwhelm me. Kinda gave me a headache  and this is coming from someone who is very energetic  loud etc. myself. Not trying to diss at all  but not loving that for an instructional video. And I wish they gave cheaper alternatives for the products used. I can't tell if the morphy line she keeps talking about is expensive or not. And honestly I feel like YouTube ppl make everything look so perfect  achieving the smokey eye is harder than it looks! And she admitted that she has been doing it for 10 years so where does that leave beginners like me? Did not enjoy. She needs to calm it down (she doesn't have to be boring  but slow it down a LITTLE)  tighten up the focus on her eyes when achieving the look  give cheap alternatives for these expensive eye makeup products and maybe explain what to do if you flub up the look. This would help it to be a better video IMO,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
4LZXQQNUATw,Would love to see a drug store. I'm sure you have.. But meet us common people who can't afford your high end,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

LBZLmyD3KS0,@jaclynhill  Hey Jaclyn! I just got The Jaclyn Hill palette for christmas and I'm loving it and having fun playing around with the orangey reds in the palette. It's my first professional high quality eyeshadow I've ever used!  Question though  in this video you used the M441 blending brush from morphe at the beginning of this look(which has white bristles) and then later when you put the dark burgundy shadow on you're using a different brush you say you love  but you said the same name (M441). I'm wondering what brush it actually is xD P.S I know you aren't using your palette in this tutorial haha,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
LBZLmyD3KS0,Glitter is horrible for the enviornment and is toxic. Kills animals and people who eat the animals who've  ingested glitter. Buy biodegradable glitter. Please. Its so vad for our animals and enviornment!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

6C08upOMKak,Can you PUH-LEASE do a tutorial on this look?!?!  I saw you wore a similar look in a video with manny and i'm DYING to know your secrets D;  I am a new subscriber (idk how it took me so long) but if y'all other subs have the link for this look  PLEASE SHARE IT WITH ME. Gracias :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
6C08upOMKak,Oh girl  this is going to be so much fun about difficult. I have so many to list especially in eye makeup and lip colors.  1- moisturizer would be the IT Confidence in a Cream. So lightweight and smells beautiful.  1- primer would be the Maybelline Master Prime. It blurs and smoothes out the lines on my   face.  1- foundation is the IT Compact Hydrating Fluid Foudation. I might be showing my age but I'm 42 and LOVE make-up I love wearing it and applying it. But over the past few years my skin has been changing. So.......IT has saved my skin. 1- concealer would be born this way by two face  1- setting powder would be the NYX mineral set it and don't fret it. I have used others but it makes my under eye look very dry.  1- loose powder would have to be the Maybelline Fit me. I only use this  I love it.  1- eye palette would have to be the two face chocolate bar. Omg I have used ever color in this packet. But!!!! I am looking forward to getting your eye palette. I absolutely love the colors in it. This past December Ulta had it advertised in their brochure and when I went to get it  they told me that the Waterford Store is the one that was chosen not to carry it  I'm jot going to lie  I had tears in my eyes. Moving on.  1- eyelashes the Ardell whispies love them. So natural looking.  1- mascara guaranteed the Maybelline Voluminous mascara hands down the best!!!! 1- lipstick.......ugh......this is the hard part.....Loreal liyas collection in the shade Liyas Nude. So pretty so creamy absolute love it.  1- lip gloss would have to be Victoria Secret lip shine the color tag has worn out but it's a pretty nude color  sorry.  1- liquid lipstick  Jaclyn you got me on this one from one of your tutorials  the Anastasias Beverly Hills in the shade Sephia. Giiiiirl!!! Not only does it lock on the lips  but the color is GORGEOUS!!!! I will be going to get more shades in Anastasias collection.  1- setting spray would be NYX MATTE FINISH.  Thank you so much Jaclyn for all your inspirations and keeping the love for makeup alive. Your hands down the best!! Oh forgot my ride to die perfume is 5th Avenue from Elizabeth Arden. But......i only use it on very special occasions...so I also wear Juicy Couture.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

mTHLyCqtLJE,I used to watch you all of the time when you first started out but I find myself watching less and less of you as the years pass by. I still love and adore you but everything you use in tutorials are soooooo expensive. I get it  you're wealthy (which you deserve because you are so talented) and obviously gorgeous but I wish you would use more drugstore items in your videos. When I turn to youtube for a good look on my makeup I want around $100 not $800 worth of products.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

mTHLyCqtLJE,HI Jaclyn I just discovered you on Youtube. I am a new subscriber. I think you are great and give great reviews. I was wondering if you could recommend some products for people who have allergy issues. I have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes and try to look for hypoallergenic products. The problem is  there is only a handful of product lines which make hypoallergenic products. I wonder about trying new products  but I'm hesitant because I don't know if they will irritate my eyes or not. I prefer the drugstore/walmart brands because I can afford their prices. Can you recommend some products that would be safe for sensitive eyes like mine. I'm sure there are other subscribers that have the same problem I do. Thanks so much!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
mTHLyCqtLJE,This kind of stuff is not a good example for young women. Sorry Jaclyn. You have more than enough to be content and really nothing to ever complain about publicly.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
mTHLyCqtLJE,Because you are beautiful for who you are and don't let anyone  and I mean anyone tell you otherwise.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
mTHLyCqtLJE,It must be nice to be that rich eh. Very materialistic. Life really isn't all about looks guys. Just letting everyone know. It's about what's on the inside that counts. Celebrities are famous and they have images to maintain etc. But for regular people  it's just not healthy to compare. Just be yourself ladies..,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

kOaXihv377k,Have you ever tried baby powder to bake and set?? It sounds crazy but I had a wild hair and decided to try it and for me it seemed to set and bake at the same time and holy cow!!!!! Now it's my favorite technique....haven't had any problems with it under my eye!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
kOaXihv377k,0ne question though if you went in with a winged liner on a day you want to look a little Bolder what would be your preference for the best drugstore liner to make a best wing with and easiest application!! But this is one of my fav of ur tutorials most deff a look I would love very affordable all products I would love and that seem to go o so well together not a big lippy person but love my nudes always most of the time I'll do a foundation lip that a kinda firmly rub praying my natural lip color to the surface  using my fingers  and I will then apply a clear gloss of my choice preferably one that looks extremely glossy but yet is not extremely sticky or has lots of strings streaming from one lip to the next kind of a matte gloss w a shine I know it makes no sense but they're out there you just have to take the time to find the one that best suits ur taste because I feel like a Lippy during school is just not the way I like to go it can make it seem like i did too much makeup to go to school instead of going along with my look and making it seem effortless!! Loving the under eye shadow and No Liner seems to look way less harsh!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

w5mOGEPdmSc,Hi,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
w5mOGEPdmSc,I would love to see this done again but more of a shimmer vs matte highlight.  Like when she was doing her eyes and mentioned she couldn't highlight her browbone on the matte side  I was like "girl use the shade from your lid on the browbone  it's matte"   The highlighted side was more "all shimmer everything". Like even the bronzer and blush were shimmery.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
w5mOGEPdmSc,I prefer matte side...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
w5mOGEPdmSc,What makeup sponge is that????!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
w5mOGEPdmSc,anyone know what mascara she used ?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

w5mOGEPdmSc,I actually really like Matte better!! Well  I probably like a mix of both  but I think the matte side looks so natural and classic and beautiful.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
w5mOGEPdmSc,I totally agree the highlight side aged you and it didn't look right. The lips were nice but idk about the highlight.....dont do it over the eye anymore. That's for sure. I preferred the matte side to be honest but with a small highlight to just give your face that little umph.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Fm3qAZUOIA8,I can never understand the people that will leave really nasty comments on other people's videos. Like  why are you even fucking watching this video if you don't like the person and have nothing good to say about them? Are you THAT bored and pathetic that you watch videos of people you can't stand and just get yourself angry and then leave nasty  hateful comments? You know what I do if I don't like someone on youtube? I don't watch their videos. Plain and simple. I don't feel the need to bash them and be a disgusting rude person just because I'm not a fan of them. Its ok to not like someone or to disagree with them  but there's never any good reason to be so hateful and negative.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

8eJA4atThuc,My husband & I married very young  having 2 kids. I thought he had substance abuse issues  and it was rough. We ended divorced in our 20s  but we realized he was bipolar. Once diagnosed & treated  substances were never an issue again. He wasn't an addict  just self-medicating young not knowing what was wrong  which is common. We remarried quickly  had 3 more children (total 5) and had many very happy years. In a cruel twist of fate  he died suddenly at only 45.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
8eJA4atThuc,You have to care about dreams and maybe you and Jon are dealing with this tsunami right now.... And you have to stay close to handle it,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

She used to also do that digging thing  we have the holes under the rug to prove it lol thumbs up if you think a dog snoring is adorable  I know Ido ^_^,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

evRtM3kuWBU,Everyone saying shit like "Tati is more honest"  but it's like... did you even watch her damn video? SHE LIKES IT. SHE EVEN SAID SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO USE IT. And Jaclyn has complaints too ;) She's ALSO a professional makeup artist. She has been doing makeup for so many years  so she probably knows how to work a hard-to-blend shadow.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Gosh you lying bitch I'm ashamed of you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I'm never trusting you agian. Why does everyone have to change when they get millions of subscribers on YouTube,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

evRtM3kuWBU,Sit-treen and ub-city-in,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

evRtM3kuWBU,Who else actually had common sense and know that when she said obsidian  that she was reading the wrong one because obsidian is a black colorn,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I have the 35o... im good,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I don't understand why put powder on in the middle of doing the shadow.. is it to hide fall out? Or did you forget,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,how much is it?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Girl  I love your energy but DAMN you talk fast!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,this has way too much hype. Literally  you can find something much cheaper with the same quality.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Wait does anyone know where her shirt is from??,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,the shadows are basic  you can get those shadows anywhere  I rather save my money and by a morphe palette  more bang for your buck.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,BS review. Who would watch this? Curiosity brought me here. I'll pass  1 minute was all I could take.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,i am so jealous of the shape/size of her eyelids!!! So random but i know we have all thought of how amazing her eyelids look!! So perfect for eyeshadow!!! XD Love you Jaclyn!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,her pallets has the most basic shadows... half my pallets half those colors.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,U have the Beautiful Eyes. With and Without Makeup. Just Subscribed. Stay Honest n Gorgeous,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Slay girl slay,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Loved this video... But I'm wondering about the red bruises on the insides of her lip?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Hmm  I came here after watching Kathleen Light's ride or die tag video and I've heard of Jaclyn Hill from the BECCA products  and I've gotta say this video... was awful. Just applying layer over layer over layer of shadow  not creating any specific shapes or anything just slapping it on. And to try and apply a light shimmer/satin shade on top of 3 layers of dark brown shadow!? How is that ever gonna work. I don't think this was a good representation of this product. I own this palette and would say it's an equal favourite with my too Faced sweet Peach palette. The matte shades blend sooo beautifully and are so pigmented  the shimmer shades look like a shimmer in the pan but have more of a satin finish on the eye  they could be better tbh. But I definitely think it's a great palette and this does not do it justice.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,You are so cool! Love all your videos! <3 With love from Philippines! :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,i love her dramatic ness hahahhahahha omg i love her so much xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I love how she says "she made this and she made that" like she actually did something else than having a name,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Can I get free makeup??,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Love this look on you! Very natural and pretty!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,What powder did she use under her eyes??,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I don't know if someone had already mentioned this in the comments but all the colors in that palette are named after natural stones. Most people don't know how to pronounce those names. I admit I did face palm when you kept mispronouncing citrine.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Love your look,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I love your videos but you kinda of talk too much.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,No offence but  I cannot tell the difference of  the colors on you lid   they are all chocolate brown!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,Is she high on something? Overacting is little too excessive... I was actually watching How to remove bee stinger and idk how I reached here..,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

evRtM3kuWBU,I love how she immediately knows what colour to compare it to it's so cute,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,ive heard so much hype about you and your makeup  and you came across my recommendations  and i have to say..i am obsessed i love when youtubers are goofy and are themselves while doing what they love instead of being super serious :) loooove itttt,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,The comments on this video are so childish. At the end of the day  calm down. It's just makeup. I don't care to buy from this brand because nothing from their line speaks to me and I don't care for the hype but that doesn't mean the products are automatically crap and people aren't allowed to like them! Even though I don't care about the palette I love watching this video to see how genuinely excited Jaclyn is to be filming and also she has a lot of good information that has helped me with my eyeshadow game.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,I need to get these ASAP!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
evRtM3kuWBU,why is everyone so mean? she is so sweet and funny and the make up is beautiful. yall are jealous af,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

evRtM3kuWBU,at s.diaz and all the bitches hating what yall gotta say bout the burgandy palette,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Whatever that is that you are wearing.... A top or a dress... Is everything! So unique! You look beautiful.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,jaclyn please help! I was in a similar situation with my ex and he still won't leave me alone. I need some advice I don't have anyone to turn to that would understand. I hope you see this and can message me. i feel alone in this.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I go back and watch this video so much. I went through the exact same thing and I cry every time I watch this,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,This is exactly like my ex boyfriend and he calls me crazy what do i do,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,THANK YOU. Thank you thank you  I just got out of a baddd relationship  and I have doubts about it all the time and miss him. This just reassured me that I will NEVER settle until I find what I deserve and to hopefully find my own Jon Hill. Love you girl.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I definitely went through a similar situation but I dont understand why in your current videos and in your snap stories you claim that you didn't go to college yet in this video you said you did like damn get your stories straight girl stop lying.. not hating js...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I know this is from 2016 but just had to say how relatable this is and I really appreciate your honesty <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I never comment on videos but I have to  your ex has narcissistic personality disorder and so does my ex  I had the exact same experience as you. The funny thing is your husband contacted him about us 4 to meet and do dinner together years ago and I regret not making it happen. You are strong and I respect you so much.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You're so adorable and unique you easily differentiate yourself from other youtubers wo even trying :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Thank you Jaclyn that was very brave to share. I'm learning about controlling dysfunctional men and how to deal with them.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Literally what I went through lol  love your confidence! Cant wait for the day ill be able to talk about my dysfunctional without crying lmao!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,oh my god i don't ever leave comments but this video. THIS VIDEO. literally exactly what i experienced. When jaclyn talked about not being allowed to wear heels and makeup i was like HOLY SHIT!!!!! from finding him not attractive  to promising to marry me to tearing me down  for making me work for his affection  this video got it down to a T. he also blocked all my guy friends on fb  told my best guy friends fuck u and they thought it was me and got so mad at me  lost friends because of him and he ended up cheating on me :-) but hey what did I know i was only 15.  but mannnnn did i move past it and found someone way better  almost perfect and I'm just happy realizing how much more i was worth in the eyes of others. happy for jaclyn and everyone else who got out of toxic relationships,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I too have been with a mind controlling psycho and then had a kid with my best friend of 14 years ! be careful of those putting on charm ... those charmers that wink is the bad combo and dead give away   I am so grateful for my husband because he is opposite of my ex and I got with him shortly after breakup with ex was with ex's cousin and stopped at my now husbands to pee lol I met him thru his roomate and mutual friend with ex's cousin ... yea we got together took a 5 year engagement and just married after he had 2 unsuccessful back surgeries last Feb and April and I just had to work 3 jobs and lots of OT no days off for past 2 years but the struggle is worth the love story ... he is AMAZING and I do not regret kmy ex because I LEARNED so much ... ALWAYS GO WITH YOUR GUT FEELING NOT BRAIN ... because me and hubby went thru obstacles like crazy where we are strongest we can be and best friends... You and I Jaclyn are like 2 of the same !!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You are gorgeous. Such prrsonality. Slay girl,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I miss this Jaclyn!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,He sounds like a full blown narcissist. Love you Jaclyn!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Your amazlng girl,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Oh honey I needed to watch this so much tears are streaming ...my relationship is was can be so toxic and I'm trying so hard to get out its so hard yet getting easier threat after threat he can't live with me or be around any of my kids yet he has this power over me but I have taken a stand!!! At this point I'm done!!!! But he won't leave me alone we shall see thanks for sharing so empowering to me your amazing,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I've experienced the same thing with my ex boyfriend from my 18th to my 22nd  it's wheird to hear that the same thing happened to you and so many of the commenters over here!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Really needed this   thank you girl :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,2018... I love rewatching your videos Jaclyn!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You could have just blocked his number,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Showing up so late for this. But  damn! As you were telling the story of your relationship  I sat here and realised it was almost EXACTLY the same as my ex. I left him almost 2 years ago now  in May. It was as dysfunctional and mentally/emotionally abusive as yours.  But  it is almost exactly the same. Honestly  knowing you had Jon and are with him  gives me so much hope for myself. I really needed to hear this.  Thank you for sharing such a tough experience in your life. I don't know you  but I am so happy you found happiness. Thank you.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I love this video because I can relate to this for more reasons than one. You are amazing and so strong! I love how true to yourself you are. I hope to get to that place soon! thanks for making amazing videos <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,is that my story you are telling people ? hahah,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Damn ! Very emotionnal,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Thank you for being real about this situation,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,The amount that I relate to this exact scenario is sickening. Literally went through this EXACT situation,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Knew about you just a couple of days ago but i am already in love with you. I can completely related to your story but those days are behind us girl. You do you and gid bless,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Wow,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Sounds like the typical narcissist! I'm really sorry you went through that. Just be grateful that you lived it and then truly learned from it. Not all of us women do. From the few videos that  I've watched of yours so far  it seems as though you finally ended up with your soulmate AND the one you were meant to be with... That's truly awesome!     "SOMETIMES THINGS FALL APART SO BETTER THINGS CAN FALL TOGETHER."     P.S. The reason I added the "AND the one you were meant to be with" is because not all soul mates can "make it work" (for many different reasons)...I hope that makes sense to those who read this~lol. If I need to elaborate prior to it making sense to anyone  please don't be afraid to say so. It's a conversation I've had with numerous different people on numerous different occasions and I do believe anyone I've ever talked to about it was on the same page as I was in that regard. I also know that not everyone believes we have soul mates  but that's for another convo  all together~lol.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Don't downplay it girl  emotional abuse can be traumatizing!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,He accused you of flirting etc.  because he was doing those things. I am glad you finally woke up.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You remind me of adrian bailon :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Ugh I just feel this. I understand this on such a huge level.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You're such a good storyteller lol Half an hour later and I didn't even notice XD,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Hi Beautiful   what watch are you wearing in this video? It is Michele watches?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I should be able to take a 30 minute break if I want to and play with gummy bears.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I think more people need to see this video. Sounds like our exs could be brohers lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Can we get more real talk from Jaclyn? Please?!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Ugh he sounds like my ex boyfriend.  6 minutes in and im already 100% sure he's a narcissist. People with narcissistic personality disorder act literally exactly the same in every relationship. Ladies beware,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,This makes me feel a lot better knowing moving on fast from a dysfunctional and mentally abusive relationship IS okay!! It's comforting knowing you're not the only one :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I felt you so much when you started talking about the emotional pain you felt after confirmation that what you felt in the pit of your stomach was true. Unfortunately I've been there more than once and I'm going through that right now. I'm sorry you dealt with bullshit like that.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,God bless,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You're so raw and real in this video. Love you  momma.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I wasnt really physically attracted to any of my exes. The guy im currently with is the only guy I immediately thought was hot as soon as I laid eyes on him.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Wow this hit home so badly,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I love your personality !,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I recently ended a very abusive and toxic relationship.. What you said is true  it can happen to anyone  and it is very easy to get caught up in a relationship like that. When I ended up things I was in pretty bad shape even when I was the one who broke it off  because it has not been easy for me to recover from those 3 years of emotional  psychological and physical abuse... However  I have a family that is always there to support me and friends who truly want the best for me  and they have helped me to recover the strong independent woman that I know I am. It's really sweet of you to share your story  and let people that have been through something similar know that they don't have to tolerate that kind of manipulation and abuse. I know you uploaded this video in 2016  and it's one day away of being 2018  but you really made me feel like I'm not alone through this right now  and gave me hope that one day I will find a good man who will truly love me for me. Thank you for always being you Jaclyn! Love you!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,Honestly  I think it's very brave to talk about all of this!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I've been in toxic friendships like this where my friends would put me into peer pressure and make me feel so bad and then one day I just got tired of it and let them go,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I have never related to something more.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,You were the most amazing thing that ever happened to him  #fuckhim #skert #boybye,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,this is literally me I feel this on a spiritual level,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I am so thankful for stumbling across this video. Thankyou so much Jaclyn  this has had a massive impact!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,My friend showed me this video when I was in an abusive relationship. It brought me to tears and helped me feel not so lost. Really appreciate the realness!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
wWbQrrNmC34,I love this! this actually made me move on from my last relationship so thank you!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MmMq5-1ZnwI,I don't know if you're going to see this cuz it's on an old video  but I have the same issue as  you regarding the cracked lips in the morning. I recently got the Hanalei Lip Treatment in the shade Rose and I use it as a night lip mask. And let me tell you: it is PERFECTION! (As Chandler would say :P) I have a bag of chapsticks I carry around because I have such an issue with dry lips and this the ONLY thing I have come across that has a long-enough lasting effect. I don't know if you have already come across this product because I just started watching you and I started about 3 years back and am working my way up to now. I hope you get to see this and get a chance to get the lip treatment because it is life changing. And PS thank you for being such an unapologetic goofball on your channel. As someone who dealt with a lot of bullying because of my quirkiness and sense of humor  it means a lot to me to see someone so genuine and beautifully funny. Thank you <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MmMq5-1ZnwI,hehe  i dont know why i had this idea with this video.. but i think it would be SO interesting and So cool if beauty youtubers  such as yourself did a video kind of dealio where you would pick products that were products as if you could only have that one in that catagory for example like "if i was stranded or cast away and i could only pick one blush to take with me it would be.... NARS blush in the shade "madly" and then you tell us why. lol just a thought.. it made more sense in my head but it i guess is kind of like an ALLL TIME FAVORITES VIDEO  with a more unique title  im sure you could volve the idea into something grea  if you even see this comment...

Natural shampoo or add the raw...all natural honey to ur shampoo. 3)Organic apple cider vinegar..you'll have to research which 1 is best due to ur hair dye the honey kept making my hair lighter.Don't worry girl the day I formulate/create the perfect shampoo n conditioner.....I'll keep u in mind.Every woman has issues with her hair too dry too oily too Straight  too curly...etc Just praise God u have it  and work with it=)Take care Gorgeous.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

jiuqe-C5bnY,Came here to comment on the Kim/Jaclyn video because I honestly loved it. It made me gain respect for Kim  she was so professional with Jaclyn  she didn't act like she was some enormous celeb in comparison. Also  those videos titled "Jaclyn Hill annoying Kim Kardashian" are a total lie. I saw those first before the tutorial  and how they were edited did seem like she was aggrivated but once I saw the tutorial I felt like they were genuinely learning and hanging out together.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MFRoyFcqzZ4,I've been putting a gloss over liquid lips forever! It makes it look like a super pigmented  opaque gloss. My favorite is using Kylie Cosmetics' literally gloss over their candy k matte formula.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,I need a foundation that is good for dry  red  sensitive skin as soon as I put anything on my face it turns red. I break out extremely easily usually just bumps and occasionally a few white heads and my face is extremely dry. But the problem I have with dewy foundation is I find it slides right off my face or transfers. But I want a medium to full coverage cause of the freckles and Imperfections I have  on my skin. Any suggestions? I have the Mac sculpt in nc25 for color reference. Even tho I think it's too light but they color matched at Mac,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,Love your shirt  where is it from?! Xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

MFRoyFcqzZ4,"Don't mind me if I look sweaty right now..."  *clears throat* Me: Um u look flawless asf,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,For the foundation what brush do you recommend to apply it?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,Jacyln-  You have got to do a music playlist girl! Especially since you do your thing and have a solos dance party as part of your video. :) That cheered me up so much- you don't even know!!!!  Love  Love  Love you girl!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,"I'm so pale right now..." *looks at Jaclyn's skin tone* *looks over at my bottle of Makeup Forever Y205 Alabaster Foundation*  *looks back at Jaclyn* Oh my sweet summer child....,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,I bought the Josie Maran foundation based off this video. I'm extremely oily & thought I'd give it a shot since NO foundations stay on my face. Ina nutshell  it feels great but you definitely feel the oils & it's harder to control any shine. I do NOT recommend this for oily skin!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
MFRoyFcqzZ4,omg lmbooo i could have sworn i saw the nat fly into your mouth! LOLOL,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

I loooove watching your videos. You are so positive  crazy and completely yourself. I went through the comments  and I cannot see where those mean comments come from... Some are just smaller and cling to others shoulders to pull themselves up. Ignore them. They do not know you or understand you. There are plenty of us who support you  for who you are. You are definitely my favourite YouTuber and i love your snapchat stories and your love for your family.  Do you boo and stand tall <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
KVq6byrDM0c,Are you suppose to color correct on top of your foundation? I always thought you were suppose to do it right after your primer,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

KVq6byrDM0c,Did she only use shore thing  dragonfly  and aqua? She seems like she skipped the part of what she put on her lid and maybe needs to redo this tutorial or at least the eye part please help someone :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
KVq6byrDM0c,looks like a huge patch of bronzer on ur cheeks,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

KVq6byrDM0c,I'm sorry but I'm confused as to what you put on your lid.  You stated you put "this gorgeous pigment that you're in love with" and briefly showed a color but then you went right into talking about chameleon so I think I missed something.  Please help,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

mXFuBgaztyY,You are so beautiful it's insane,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
mXFuBgaztyY,Can you please do a review of your cool laser treatment? I am looking for the best way to treat my hyper pigmentation and the damage I did to my skin being a lifeguard! It would be great if you talked to your followers MORE about protecting themselves from the sun. I tanned in tanning beds and didn't wear sunscreen like I should have when lifeguarding. I was diagnosed with melanoma at age 28 and have had to have multiple surgeries and have to have check ups constantly. I am cancer free now  but maybe you could talk more about the SPF benefits that some makeups offer (I use IT Cosmetics foundation which has a great SPF  but I put Neutrogena sunscreen under my primer). Girls are getting diagnosed daily with skin cancer that can kill.   You have such a platform. Let's hear you talking more about what spray tans you use to look your best and how they're SO SO MUCH BETTER than tanning in a tanning bed!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

lTAChvJvMBA,Hooded Eye Note: angling the liner toward the tail of your brow ONLY works if you don't have hooded eyes. If I did that my hood would completely cover the black liner. And THANK YOU Jaclyn for what you said about aging skin and using less product. I think you are a long way from having aging skin  because it still looks flawless  but you are also the first YT to acknowledge that once the skin starts the aging process more isn't always better.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

bcMmXXr3N0M,i LOVE your friends references! i'm on round four of rewatching it and no shame!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I suffer from awful anxiety for so so long and I've heard so many ways to try and deal with it and you literally just made my cry talking about it because what you just said made so much sense and it's so awesome to know other people that have gone through it. I would completely recommend you to make a anxiety/depression video because I think you could impact a lot of people. Totally understand if you don't though  love you!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I don't know when exactly but this past year or so I've been so full of anxiety and panic over the silliest things and I'll cry and get frustrated but I've always been so in my own head as you put it I guess the anxiety panic part I'm just now noticing,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,This is an older video  but if anyone is as affected by Jaclyn's points about anxiety as I am  I recommend reading "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl.  It's a short book that simply confirms what Jaclyn said in that you cannot control what happens to you  but you can control how you feel <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Makeup is soo BOMB in this vid!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,For her own make up line she wasn't talking about the pallet right?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,one word  awesome! xo,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Just wanted to let you know that you talking about your anxiety even just in that snippet has been so helpful for me. Every time I have a panic attack I actually have it waiting for me right when you start talking about anxiety. Hope that isn't creepy or too weird  just wanted to say thanks for helping me through so many panic attacks and bad days!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Video on how you whiten your teeth?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Can you tell us that gloss on your lips yet?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,"Next spring the right house is going to pop up and it's going to be my moment...",Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Are you talking about the Morphe collab in this video when you talked about the project that has taken 2 years?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,If you did the video it would be amazing for so many people  maybe just disable the comments and let people take from it what they will.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,WAITING FOR  YOU IN PARIS  FRANCE !,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,How did u overcome the severe anxiety? I suffer from it bad!!   For years!!!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,This is probably creepy and weird but any time I'm having a bad panic attack (like right now) I watch the part where you talk about anxiety/panic attacks and it makes me feel much better  sometimes I have to watch it more then once but just wanted to say how useful and helpful it is and thank you for sharing even that snippet  I watched your snaps where you talked briefly about it too (hope that is going better by the way!) and it's all so helpful! So yeah  still coming down off a bad panic attack but wanted to say thank you for all that you do!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Ohhh Jaclyn ... I wish you were my best Friend who could be just on the end of the Phone !!! . Most of your words in this video felt like they came straight out of my mouth ... I think your an awesome human   a damn good person & anyone should call they selves bloody lucky to have you in their life . Thank you for continually posting amazing   inspiring & confident videos   I could only dream of being able to do what you do xoxo .,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,where did you get the ring you're wearing in your right middle finger? love it!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Let go and let God ! Preach woman,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,If you write a book the title should be "when the camera turns off.." I don't know why but when you said that phrase it seemed like such a great title,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Awww your challenge was working on your morphia pallete  girl! I love you and can't wait!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,u r so real  thank u about the anxiety.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I would continue to watch your videos even if you're in your fifties (this comment's a little late but yeah). Love you  Jaclyn! :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Hi Jaclyn   I had recently commented on your video about your husband's seizure about how I recently had a Grand Mal and myself and my husband are going through something similar. I am a psychotherapist and actually struggle with anxiety myself - I was actually assuming my partial seizures were increased anxiety and increased panic attacks. So I highly relate and have been watching your videos while off from work recovering the last few days. I've been working through an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy approach workbook I would highly recommend for working through and accepting what you can and cannot control in your life. Best wishes on your life journey.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You're amazing. Thank you <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You're a boss ass BIHHHHH. I just love you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I definitely think you should make a video of how you whiten your teeth. I'm so self conscious about my teeth and yours are perfeccct. I love you so much,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,People with anxiety being some of the most creative is so true.   Anxiety SUCKS  and even more when people talk others down for having it or when people think it's this horrible thing which it IS but it's not going to hurt anyone else; it mainly hurts the person that has it because it's all on the inside.   You mentioned kind of forcing yourself to relax and deal with it or distant yourself and while it sounds bad that's exactly what I learned to do-- sometimes it works for me and sometimes it doesn't.   I'm glad that people have talked about it on YouTube because if I had never seen these videos that explain it and how to help it  then I wouldn't know what the hell it is.   And for the young girls that don't know what's happening (with anxiety) but have these videos to realize and relate with someone is amazing. I'm glad YouTube and the YouTubers who speak about their experiences whether with having anxiety or on the other end where they are helping someone with anxiety; they really make a difference for some people.   <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You are a beautiful soul and your talk about anxiety was inspirational and hit home. Love you.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You are so humble. Love you so much!!! Also I don't think you could look anymore stunning! Killing that outfit!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I come back to watch the anxiety part of this video  everytime I start to feel my anxiety levels rising up. I always find myself feeling more calm. Just to know that I'm not alone  and I am not a freak  makes me feel so much better about myself. So  thank you Jaclyn. I know you'll never see this  but whatever. Hahah.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Jaclyn  may I know where your choker is from? ty xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Jaclyn Hill  i am a portuguese living in germany and i would love to meet you one day  because i know there would be this connection you were talking about! you are a so amazing woman and you are so inspiring! i love you so much!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Praying that you make an anxiety and depression video. I'm like at my lowest low with it and it helps to hear other people's stories. Grav3yard girls videos helped me so much! It sounds like my situation may be similar to yours.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Can You please make A video about how You Get A whigter smile??  Love u jacy!!!! Love your videos!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Jaclyn  thank you. The past year or two I've dived deep into my beauty obsession and have almost been embarrassed about it-why do I care about how I look so much?  Watching your videos  especially this one made me realize a couple things 1. Makeup is fun and is a hobby that enhances you outside but doesn't change your insides and 2. I now realize I started my beauty habit because I have anxiety and it is something I can work on and create with. I also realize that while I still have anxiety I have had much more control over it since I got into makeup and have been happier overall. It is my outlet and you made that OK for me!  Thank you  you're fabulous BB.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,Having kids is NOT for everyone. Good for you  Jaclyn! As someone who sits in a similar position  I appreciate that you are so open about it,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,one of my most favorite videos the way you talk about anxiety just lets me relax. means so much to me. I went searching for this video saying I know I watched a video where she talked about it a long time ago <3,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I am so confused why people ask you about kids. They wouldn't be asking if you were a man. You have the right attitude. I have a child and it takes all of your time  mind and soul. (As it should). You do you. Once you have babies there is no going back. I always tell my little sister  you're only young once. When it is the right time to have babies  you will know. ;),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,I live in California!!! If anyone else does  like this comment! :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

bcMmXXr3N0M,I absolutely love what you said about anxiety. It was so spot on  and has given me such strength and peace of mind. Your insight really helped me cope with my anxiety. Thank you so much. Love you  girl.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You are just such a sweetie pie!  I love love love that your family is your #1 priority!  I've only recently started watching your videos and have many more to watch  but I've learned a lot of great techniques.  I've never done much with highlighter  but I'm ordering some so I can test it out.  Thank you for sharing your life with us!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,goodbye money I'm going to bye Jaclyn hills makeup line,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,You should do a video on anxiety! That would be awesome. There's so many people that relate and could aspire from it. :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,where did you get your phone case from? I love it! want it so bad xx,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
bcMmXXr3N0M,love you and your videos so much!!! I have severe anxiety and it's nice to here you be so open and give good advice! and you are so beautiful!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

EctsFU4kriw,Call me crazy but I actually don't think this looks that bad lol. I mean  I've seen way worse!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,The pattern and colors you use for the eyes reminds me of a monarch butterfly.  Granted it's not the best for everyday wear  but I can certainly see something like this for a fantasy/fairy photo shoot.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I like the eyes.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Too bad she didn't get John's reaction..,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

EctsFU4kriw,I love this look!!! You look awesome!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I was bullied in school since the sixth grade. I did my makeup starting when I was 12  I just did my eyes and I used foundation and powder. I had very limited fundage to buy it so I got the makeup I would get would be from neighbors and friends from school,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,NO POWDER HUNNYYYYY NOOOO,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,this wig............wheres it from,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I searously doubt she used some of these techniques back then  a little hard to believe,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,As soon as I clicked on the video I realized  that she is SO extra,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,You look sooooo gorgeous without make up!!! Love your kinda light freckles!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

EctsFU4kriw,I hope you actually like guns n roses .,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,So where did the blend blend blend come into your life?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I never used eyedshadow at all in highschool. I would put on concealer (sometimes)  then the foundation on top and pressed powder (not translucent loose powder) on top of my foundation. Then I would add a huge black line on top and bottom  and use nude sparkly lip gloss. Sometimes I would blush it up. I thought I was killing the make up game.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,You should do a tutorial that is inspired by this! Like how you would do this today!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Girl this isn't that bad. For some dumb reason I always felt like my skin was so flawless that foundation wasn't required. Just translucent face powder two eyeshadow colors (non blended) 20 layers of mascara and super shiny lip gloss lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,As soon as she said brand new i immediately had flashbacks to the emo days of high school,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,shes being so dramatic,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I had a feeling  she would be a scene type back in high school.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,when you realize that this is how you do your make up now and its considered wrong... o.o whooops,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,that wig isn't blond,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Whos here in 2018?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,0:17,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,She still pulls it off,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,U are so cute omfg,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Your makeup still looks good lol   I'm so late haha but you remind me of kesha with the wig lol.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Who tf used MAC in highschool,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,When she came out I thought she was Kesha,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,if she did this tutorial without saying that it was her hs makeup.... i would not know right from wrong..,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Is it wrong that I love this eye shadow look?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Rawr XD lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,it doesn't look bad at all tho!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Oops thought it was kesha,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Does anyone else remember when every girl wanted that flat emo type straight hair where it was completely straight and flat. Yeah that was me.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,you should do a childhood stories video,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,so you went to a school when you were a teenager? confusedddd,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I don't think this looks that bad? Then again when I first started wearing makeup I would rock some electric bright blue eyeshadow xD,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Blend out those eyes a bit and it's not a bad look!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,That's Crazy Cause Now She A Bigg Time Make Up Guru Lol,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,she looks awesome tho,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Oh omg yess,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I had headphones  the music at the beginning got me screaming like a motherfucker. Now Jaclyn I have deep rage inside of me for you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Literally did this in high school except the pink/gold was pure white. So bad.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,Yaaas Jaclyn Brand New and TBS never die!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
EctsFU4kriw,I graduated in 86..how I did my make up in high school would be downright scary..and the hair and aqua net buzz,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
a6LGxV12r48,none,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I find it disgusting how rude & disrespectful people are to someone they don't even know! This woman has given so much of her time to make videos for us  & the second that something doesn't go your way you haters go out of your way to be extremely cruel! While your being a crybaby over ONE item that you got your $$ back on (if you even purchased) she's working hard to put out not just videos but other cosmetics! Coming on here to write disrespectful comments really makes you feel better about your own misery? Grow up...,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,So beautiful beauty's. She like white queen. Alice in wonderland AMV > https://youtu.be/3I8C8l5yRho #nevewilliams,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

vAYtyLZ8rsc,Girl  I am telling you  the Dior brow pencil is only like $5 more than Anastasia's and it is AMAZING! It is firm and tiny tiny on the top.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,what shades of foundations does she use..she never say the shade,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Oh my goodness you look gorgeous! You did such an amazing job with your makeup  and this tutorial!!!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Inglot black eyeliner is better.  :) i love maybelline blackest black but since I tried the inglot one I can't use another!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Wat eyeliner brush is that by sihlgma,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Still haven't heard her say what color the brow definer is,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,love it,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I think this is a beautiful look .but we're not all makeup artists to much work for me lol .I'd look like a mess.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I'm obsessed with my Josie Maran Vibrancy with argon oil foundation and it's cool to see you using it too! It's the first time I've seen it on YouTube. Also I am living for that whole eye look  expecially the eyeshadows! I've been wanting to try that lipstick myself but I've been afraid it'll be too light but after seeing it on you I might just have to bite the bullet and just go for it. The whole look is exactly my style and now I'm wanting to try all this out on me. I have the same hair color as you and just about the same complexion and I have blue eyes.  Before I Forget would you please do a video about the best nude lipsticks,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Can you do a tutorial about brushes? Like good and bad. What to do with which kinds,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I wanted to know if you've ever done the flash photo challenge? if you have how do you avoid the translucent powder mask? if not  basically it shows all the translucent powder that you've applied. And it makes a bomb face of makeup look like Casper. And I wanted to know how to avoid that.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I'm SO GLAD that other use liner in their water line!! :)) some people say NO NO NO...bc it makes the eyes look smaller.. for example in my wedding day.. the girl who did my makeup only lined  part of my eye  and I couldn't help myself  I had to fix it.. lol I've tried the whole  using eye shadow under the eye as a liner (smudged) but I CAN'T SEEM TO DO IT RIGHT!!!! UGH...HELP PLEASE LOL,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,just a random question... lol I notice sometimes you use a bright color on the lips  and other times  nude colors or baby pink...which is your favorite and what helps you decide from day to day?? considering you have so many favorites!!! :) just like me!! it's so overwhelming to me sometimes to decide... and is hard for me to decide :/,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I think this is my favorite of Jaclyn's videos.  The look is fierce yet elegant.  Appreciate the emphasis on brushes and using the right tools (I'm still working on mastering the techniques ha). Also  she's so dang funny.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Mary Kay liquid black eye liner,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,channels gel liner is REEALLY black and it's a fantastic product well worth paying extra dolars for .,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,These intros get me every time,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,... you're not supposed to mix oil based and water based! I can't believe the nerve you have to lie about being a professional makeup artist (not makeup enthusiast but artist) to give yourself credibility. This is disrespectful to the pros that had to work their ass off.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,I have always used black eye liner and bring it all the way to the rear duct,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Mabeline gel liner is the only one I use too,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

vAYtyLZ8rsc,Thank you for this tutorial! This is now going to be my go to! It looks so fire!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,My eyes are screaming. I could never do this. :( It is beautiful  but my eyes would water so badly.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
vAYtyLZ8rsc,Man  there is alot of shitty bitches always commenting under her videos. If she wear to much makeup in your opinion  then don't fucking watch. If her split ends and possibility of lip injections somehow bothers you so much that you feel the need to bring your negative ass comments  just don't fucking watch. jesus.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

Your truly an inspiration to so many and give me so much faith that dreams do come true!! You go girl!!!! #SnapChatFamALLDAY,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

oepBCXoZbzM,What do u think of the Morphe Y6???,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,are all of her fave brushes vegan? / synthetic? thanks!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Can you promise promise PROMISE me that your opinion of Morphe in this video has nothing to do with how much they pay you? I mean I love morphe so I could totally see it being true but I'm just curious,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,I'm confused over your video.  I looked on the Morphe website and plan to buy set #501 which is the Master Set and hardly any of the brush #'s you mention are in the Master Set. I would guess the master set is the most complete set. Can you please explain why hardly any brushes that you mention are in the Master Set. Just wondering where the brushes are that you promote.  Thanks!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,omg I have to get me some real good brushes. cant wait until I order!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Jaclyn please  tell me what's the  lispstick (or liquid lispstick) you used on that video.... i love that red (not too dark  not too bright). Thank you,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,The comments on the new vid are disabled bc everyone hates the morphe brushes. And she disabled the comments instead of dealing with the issue.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,I just like to know why the brushes in this video aren't the same brushes in your set that morphe is selling? I feel like you did a great job explaining the benefits of every brush and instead of going to look for each individual brush they should have all came together,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,:(((,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,i think she had a red bull before she made this video.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Your beautiful and gorgeous,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,I think this has been the best and most informative YouTube/beauty blogger video I have ever watched. I have been researching different brushes and debating if I should spend the $140 and after this video it'll be the easiest money I've ever spent! Love you girl!!,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Hi can you please tell me what the 10 percent code is. You talked so fast I can not understand:(,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,does someone know why she disabled the comments in the new favorite brushes video? :S,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

oepBCXoZbzM,Is there a video on this look..I love it,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,11:38 "I can't believe I just reference Kim k ",Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,hey jaclyn! will the morphe brushes bundle be restocking?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,I ALWAYS used to think Morphe was an expensive makeup brand  but it's actually super reasonable. LOVE  LOVE  LOVED this video! I had the morphe website tab open while you kept naming out all your fav brushes haha! Thank you :),Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,It's amazing what a difference almost 2 years makes. I read some of the comments and everybody was all wanting to buy these and not much hate. Fast forward 2 years and a favorite Morphe brush video has to have the comments disabled. Insane. What I've used of Morphe has been good. I don't know why people get so crazy about Morphe. They lose their minds and just spew hate.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

oepBCXoZbzM,I only trust you when it comes to suggesting brushes. You should be happy lol! Working on becoming a  MUA! #EstheticianLife,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Morphe Brushes suck and so does the company.  I purchased 0ver $200 worth of brushes... after 6 weeks 5 of the brushes handles separated from the brush heads.  Morphe wouldn't stand behind there product... i wrote to them this was there answer "Morphe always make sure to replace defective items. There is a 14 day policy for any damaged/defective items. I do see that this brush was purchased back in October."      Unfortunately  because it is past the policy time we are unable to replace  or refund the item but we can definitely provide you with a 15% code you can use towards your order. Morphe Brushes does not currently have a warranty on the brushes but it is something we may offer in the future.  Really are they kidding... Jaclyn you are a great makeup artist but I personally don't trust you opinion  on products...  I have sephora brushes for years that never happened to them,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,What is your commission from Morphe to promote their products?,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
oepBCXoZbzM,Jaclyn Hill's Morphe brush set is All sold out in stores and online. There's one selling on eBay for $200.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1

-gYnmUv4j-s,Do you have the "NYX Dewy Finish Setting Spray" I do  but it is not very good for combination skin like i have because it will tend to dry out your skin  but it is good for any other skin type.

I got a bad pallet and it was my second one and new something was wrong  the company apologized and replaced it  an apology goes a long way. These things happen and you learn from them and hopefully fix the issue and release it again. Anyone that hates you about it or take their anger out on you  must be miserable people......It's not like you're the one manufacturing it.,Jaclyn Hill,Jaclynhill1
