mKKdl3VVx8U,The traps arent supposed to kill them its supposed to hold them and they are not painful ive put my hand in one and they just sting,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,Am I supposed to care about coyotes? They just eat my chickens! I always let them bleed out when I kill them. Slowly and painfully. But using geese that are only mildly annoying in this way is not right  I agree.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,Coyotes are pest and using that fur is good.  It's peoples job to trap that's how they make money!  You people need to open your eyes and notice there is 2 sides with legetiment arguments.  All u do is bash them and spread false information.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,How can we tolerate those types of behavior??it's pur torture. It's unacceptable and horrifying. Are we that much retarded?are we still prehistoric human?? You want to eat  meat this is ok. The problem isn't there. No need to have them suffer. We need to change law and quick. It's Barbary! !!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,You MINDLESS SHEEPLE IF THIS HOW U FEED YOUR FAMILY YOU AND YOUR KIDS DESERVE TO STARVE.....PERIOD,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,YOUR MOTHERFUCKERS !!!!!!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,Here's the thing. It is ridiculous to humanize animals while they are  FYI  not human. They are social  sentient  etc. because it is natural  it is instinct. So does with natural selection and food chain. And FYI  we  human  are also an animal but we have been privileged to be the top of the food chain. So it's something that inevitable. Veganism is good  as a marketing and consumer style  but not as moral compass. So the solution is by doing it ethically. And in terms of ethical  I mean produced it in a way that scientifically clean whether or not it looks gross to you  i.e. slitting the throat will take out the blood completely and makes the meat cleaner. So everything should be done in moderation. And by moderation  keep the food chain balanced. Don't over-consume or under-consume. Can you imagine if we don't eat chicken  especially chickens that lived nearby human settlement? they will graze the farm  houses  etc. Because there is no natural predator for them. We are the natural predator.  But what about greenhouse gasses that' has been emitted? Duh  that's why we should make electric cars  sustainable water irigation  stop the coal and oil mining  etc.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,PETA why do we have animals?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
mKKdl3VVx8U,Goose are social and sentient animals  and should not be tortured. Animal cruelty should be eliminated by strong laws  and rigorous law enforcement.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

wFfxc1n8oHw,we don't have enough crops alone to feed the entire population and with the amount of growth in global population happening annually  a much larger share of the population  if everyone were to be vegan  would have zero food at all.

iQxWOTCjg74,no there not beaten to death you idiots I'm 15 I've been trapping since I was 8 we often remove them from the traps and put them into a different area that way the raccoons don't eat the turkey eggs and don't get a chance to kill the mother hen or that way the coyote doesn't hurt the deer population. And yes we do kill the animal for the fur but we also eat the meat from the animal we also trade the fur for things we need like wood or canned goods. For just once PETA please do your research you can't just judge an entire group of people just by the bad ones spend a week with a Minnesotan trapper and you won't get what your saying,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Can't yall just use fake fur  like fabric???,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Nice ass jacket,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,uh...ill take the jacket please,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,They make fur trapper look bad there is a limit on animals killed I don't know what they did to that foothold but that wasn't a regular foothold I've been traping sent I was 12 I got my hand stuck in one before but it didn't break my bone  it did hurt but not to that bad,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Nah i saw wolf getting hurt kill all humans they must be destroyed,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Cruel beast.Go vegan,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,yes  yes it is.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Its also cheaper to make stuff with fake fur  so real fur is finacially retarded.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Very worth it. I make a crap ton of money fur trapping every season.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Frankly it depends on where I are and the tradition of the people. I'm native american and I have hunted before the traditional way (bow arrow club) and with a gun. it was awesome and now he's hanging on my wall and not eating the baby chicks.  I'm in the fence about trapping. Coyotes are considered a nuisance for a reason. They aren't big but they can be a problem when too close to home. They'll eat your cats and your cats' food (that happened to a neighbor) but If it's done only for stupid fashion... I say that's messed up and unnecessary pain so someone can think they look good. Food? I'm fine with that coyote stew tastes like beef. Bonus? Beads and tools or something but anything than just taking its skin that's so wasteful. Also it's weird but hunting liscinse  is how game wardens make sure no one is poachers,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Dank lies,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,So sad to see these popular jackets suffer #bootstrapping,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,does fake fur count?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Poor creatures that's why I never use jackets or sweaters with even fake fur on them,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Trapping is not cruel. We don't tell you to trap so don't tell us not to trap,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Stop being bitch,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Why are people horrible?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,But think of how many aninals the animal being trapped killed,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Dumbass liberals  we have been trapping animals for 100s to thousands of years for food and clothing. Next time when it's below 29 and ur naked and close to hypothermia you will come to reality,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,No  it's not worth it,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,It is worth it,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,This is just so cruel.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,All of you who are posting these asinine comments on PETA's videos need to consider something: you aren't making a difference in the world  PETA and their supporters are. We are winning and the best you people can do is post comments to get a laugh. If all of you despise this organization  why don't you do something about it? Why don't you do something to resolve the issue  stand up for what you think is right  like PETA does? I'll tell you why: because none of you have the courage to. You all are nothing but people sitting at your computers  doing nothing to support nothing but yourselves. Your ignorance  immaturity  disrespect and petty trolling is what makes us stronger. We are winning the battle for animals  and there is absolutely nothing any of you *will do about it but make "witty" post on the internet* Animals will have their salvation;  things are changing at a very swift pace in the world. So  yes  make all of the fun of PETA you would like  it's not going to prevent us from completing our mission. Thank you.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,the hipocrisy lol - watch?v=yFF6FFCASII,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,How do you think we lived back in the old days? Get used to it. We need shit like this to stay safe and to live  even if it means killing an animal. I can understand abuse is a horrible thing  but we cant truly stop it no matter how hard we try to. And converting to vegan isnt going to make the earth an easy place to live in  because we need animals to die off in order to keep a healthy amount of animals in the world  and to have nutrition :/  Idk if any of this made any sense  but its survival of the fittest boi,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Those kind of jackets should be banned there should be something asides fur,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Worth it yes,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Why people are so interested in taking lives of other docile  innocent creatures and want to change them into bags and jackets . We consider ourselves to be one of the most intelligent of the creatures   but if we are then why don't we just use other alternatives instead of killing these poor animals . The people who buy these products are equally responsible for taking lives of these animals . Why doesn't government take strict measures against these maniacs ?? I am a lover of animals  when I watch such videos I feel extremely sad for these poor animals who have done nothing to us .  Be it my life or someone elses life   each one of us has the equal right of living in this beautiful planet   and these people have no right to take lives of these mute yet astonishing creatures.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,You guys have no idea how violent nature is. We should not abuse animals  but we are just taking part in nature by hunting and fishing.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,If they are going to take their lives for fur  they could at least make it painless and only take the elderly ones so the young ones can live their full lives,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,This is funny,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,You people dont have a clue what actually happens in the real world,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,why does anyone think real fur is necessary to have on clothes? maybe I'm just sensitive but even as someone who doesn't buy animal products  this is still sad to see. I have no idea how people can condone the use of real fur when there are so many synthetic options out there that don't involve an animal suffering to make them,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Yes Peta! How many animals do you euthanize every year? I know you will delete this comment  but here it is!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,This horrified me to my very soul.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,I like foxes.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,This is why I love wearing jackets,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,Fur trapping is cruel if it just for the fur. But the animals are not trapped for just their fur. There is a LOT more to this story than just fur. Predators are removed to PROTECT other animals like deer and turkey. 1 Animal get's killed so 10 can life. And also most hunters use duke cage traps so they can release/relocate an animal if they got the wrong 1. Not every predator they catch is killed.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,GUYS DISLIKE THIS VID!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,I have a question though. Animals eat bugs. So bugs are ok to eat? It's a practice to eat locusts and scorpions.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
iQxWOTCjg74,is it worth it? heck yeah it is! specially if the caught critter is a coyote. i just wish they would have kicked it around like a soccer ball for a few hrs with spiked shoes. i know you peeps are for being nice to animals  but coyotes don't deserve anything beyond a torturous slow death  and i will wear the fur and drink the tears of each one any chance i got. let's make coyotes everywhere extinct  then you wouldn't have to worry about stuff like this. until that happens  let's enjoy playing this video a few more times and dream.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

Wbqd8BAQ1Vs,Why are people doing this??? I dont understand!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
Wbqd8BAQ1Vs,Most suppliers use animals that were going to die anyways  either from sickness or fatal injuries. While freezing and drowning are terrible ways to kill an animal  euthanasia will most likely ruin organs that would need to be studied.   Also: do you think Leonardo da Vinci cared when he opened up human bodies for research? No. But it was crucial to the medical and science field. The same has happened for literally every animal species known to man. By gathering this information we are able to cure illnesses that we wouldn't have known about if we hadnt studied the animal's bodies  and possibly would have let many more die because of it.   Now I'm not defending the dissection of this many animals; I believe this event should only happen in a scientific environment. Not every Highschooler in every school everywhere needs to open one.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

Listen up here heartless supplier companies. Look at my face when I talk to you. You will die horribly when I freeze you and drown you and inject you with latex.

Wbqd8BAQ1Vs,you do realize the animals have to be alive to get prime quality  also rats and pigeons are nowhere near endangered. Now before you say  "YOU HEARTLESS FREAK! HOW COULD YOU BE OKAY WITH ANIMALS DYING!!1!1111" It is for science  and all things die. PETA  there is no use in trying to make people vegans and "save the world" when we are all gonna die anyways.

Wbqd8BAQ1Vs,I refuse to dissect animals that came from places like this  I get it if they died from normal death or a disease but these are people's pet cats  and other animals they could have saved but killed instead. I am 11 (turning 12) and I have already learned so much about animals and how they work without having to cut open an animal.

zHi53UivwEI,Is this Tania Roth a sadist? Does She love her evil work? How cruel and demented. All the money people are socking away from the torture of animals will soon be worth nothing. Scriptures say people will be throwing their gold and silver into the streets when they realize its not going to save them. Only a good relationship with The true God and following his son can save us. I can not picture Jesus or his early followers doing such things. I don't believe anyone in their right mind would do such things to creatures who only want to live. Some who do such things to animals have possibly convinced themselves this is ok so they can get funded and put  money in their pockets. There's other jobs. Decent jobs. I don't believe these jobs can be called decent.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

MnsfnF3A5rE,That surgeon will be that mice in the next life.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
MnsfnF3A5rE,I agree that this procedure is disturbing and I would not do it to any animal  but I think some context is needed. 1) this procedure  producing what is called parabiosis  is used to study the specific role of immune/blood cells or aging. It allows researchers to study the specific role of specific cell types in diseases and infections through a "continual transfusion" method. 2) this is the LAST resort approved method to study immune responses/aging  like those mentioned  used only when other methods cannot be. Approval to use such a procedure is only given if all other methods would be inaccurate. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at any institution does not allow this procedure unless all other avenues have been explored.  I am NOT trying to justify the use of the procedure  merely provide CONTEXT. As presented  this video makes it seem as though it is being used just to make franken-mice. Veterinary staff and researchers would NOT do this unless they met the above mentioned requirements and are trying to study disease to improve medical treatments. Our understanding of HIV  Sickle cell anemia  lymphoma  and other blood diseases has  unfortunately  come from this procedure. Current treatments for people who suffer with the disease would not exist without it.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

Ux8eLu_AWQY,At my school  we dissected rats. Of course my friends and I didn't  but everyone else was excited to cut up an animal. They were saying things like  "I can't wait to see it's guts!" Or perhaps  "I'm gonna chop off it's head!" And things worse. Nobody took it seriously.  I remember when we were out in the hallway doing our rat research and quiz  just three of us  my teacher told us to deliver a box of toothpicks to another teacher downstairs. When we got there she told us to tell the art teacher she didn't need them anymore because we'd taken care of it. We got back up and saw my art teacher just barely walk into the classroom. She stepped in and came out crying  purely because she has two pet rats. (Which are the sweetest things in the world  i've known this teacher since I was young) And we talked her through it. She didn't know the dissection was happening. It's mind scarring  really.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

rgp_DDYlOHI,I wrote a poem about animal testing.  "You too" I struggle in pain as you scream at me. My heart is breaking everyday. My feet are sore  my tears are rolling. What did I ever do to you? I see the others  shocked and dead. I run in circles in my prison  filled with dread. I cry out everyday  but you still wont listen. I am taken out of my cage  i think im being freed! Oh no  whats that? That gray thing over there? You bring me to it and hold me tight. I feel something sharp being struck into my back. My eyes burn as you put on something black. My skin is wounded as you spray mist on me. My beautiful fur is gone falling  as you rub something on it. I am a experimental dog. I feel pain too.   Why? Why could you be so cruel?  They told me dogs jump around in big fields. Catching frisbees  getting rubs  and sleeping on a bed. But this is a hell  a hell for dogs.  A small crate in a dark room is no place for a dog. Nor do syringes or mascara belong on me. I am a dog.  I donot look like you. I donot feel like you. I donot smell like you. But I am human too.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
rgp_DDYlOHI,The argument I commonly see is absolutely idiotic. Here's how it goes: *whiny voice* "How would it feel if we were experimented on like those animals are?"

Now  this was an old vid and my views are only relevant to me and anyone who shares these views so please don't hate but understand that the animals there are taken care of better than animal in the black market. (I am a recent viewer and am not very knowledgable about this topic) I may be mistaken but there are 2 ways of adoption of an animal pet stores and the black market.

They don't realise what they do in the dark is seen by God and His ARMY OF GOOD ANGELS. WICKED ANGELS MUST BE BEHIND SOMETHING SO HEINOUS. Seeing this dog is heart wrenching. People that do these things have to be mentally ill. Depraved..Let these animals GO! And for the love of God put the ones that can't be saved out of their misery.  This had got to be one of the worse cases of animal torture I've seen. What really concerns me is what are we not seeing. Innocent animals and humans will get relief when Jesus and his army of angels come to destroy all evil from this planet. 2 Thessalonians 1: 6- 10 .

4xpYBqN6FCs,PETA sucks  but I'd listen to James Cromwell read the phonebook  so I hesitate to downvote this...

4xpYBqN6FCs,I confess  this commercial is brilliant !!! What would a Catholic omnivore say now?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,non-human animals are God's creatures are they not? Why would God give them nervous systems and the ability to feel pain fear and emotions  so they would feel pain and suffering and terror when humans exploit them? And the fact we do it for money is even more anti-Jesus. Funny how the right wing American "Christians" who make lots of money  sometimes out of abusing god's animals forget all of the above  isn't it?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Great!!!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,15 million $ of Vegans donations were paid for this AD)))  Unforgiving vegan priest who didn't read the Bible   @Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you.@ Genesis 9:3-4   Totally worth it LOL)),PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,"GET UP  PETER. KILL  AND EAT!",PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,I know theres trolls  and I know theres people who are offended or laughing....... but I feel so empowered after watching this commercial. The torture that these animals go through is so pointless. Vegans have proven time and time again that there is no health benefit to eating animals. There's an urgency to go vegan  and billions of lives are at stake. We do have to draw the line somewhere... Go vegan!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,As usual you have meat eaters acting like petulant children in response to a plea for compassion for nonhuman animals. Pathetic losers. All day long Arby's tells them what to do but when it's vegan they whine "don't tell me what to do". Selfish morons plain and simple.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,meat eaters leaving comments like they're so afraid somebody is going to take their meat away along with their guns ;),PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,It's no wonder why many vegan kids are now getting mineral and vitamin depletion. One can always tell a vegan: sunk in eyes  yellowish skin  lethargy  trouble with comprehension  blurred vision  all as a result of severe mineral and vitamin depletion from not eating a proper diet of meat. Vegan's never look healthy. Perhaps that is why the American Indian was a meat eater.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Man I'm starving who's up for some steak or better yet free range chicken which is actually a thing (suprise face!),PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,This commercial has really inspired me... I'm going out tonight and buy 10 KFC Buckets of Chicken and then promptly discard them in the trash... oh... the... humanity... 20 chickens just died solely because of this commercial!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,I thought it was a great ad (Yahoo and their nonstop censorship and propaganda not so much) and I love eating meat too. If God did not want us to eat meat he would have made cows run faster. You never see anyong eating a cheetah. Think about that :-),PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Good ad. Too bad it didn't play during the super bowl,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,your commercial is bad and you should feel bad!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,This  video is inappropriate.  You're using the catholic religion in a terrible way giving Christianity a bad wrap. All this money you could have put into saving animals you spent on this commercial??? So many people who watched this video have no idea about the Ag world  and how the animals are treated so who are they to judge?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,LMAO at the comments.  These necrovores hit every single spot on the Defensive Omnivore Bingo Card.  BINGO!  As if we haven't heard it all - and every one a completely selfish statement.  Hey  people  what about the animals?  The ad makes you want ro go eat some veal?  Bunch of unthinking Troglodytes.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Over the top,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,I really hate the comments on this video. Just a bunch of petty people trying to hate on veganism.....,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,Go vegan go vegan go ... away,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,If PETA moved all of its spending away from self-defeating  shaming inquisitions  and *reinvested everything into research and development of tissue engineering for the purposes of creating economically viable  death-free meat*   the organization would save the lives of billions of animals. Thus far PETA has only invested a few million dollars into in-vitro meat. Though a tiny number of lab grown meat products have made it to grocery stores  there remain massive hurdles if traditional slaughterhouse meat is to be challenged. It's not just around the corner. Engineered Meat has to be leaner  tastier  healthier  cheaper  etc if any progress is to be made. PETA's vanity is killing the dream of cruelty free meat.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Time to go get a steak.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,PETA will spend millions of dollars on useless advertising or taking people to court  yet if they just took that money and built better animal shelters to help improve pet adoptions  they could actually make a difference.  Instead they just push their idealistic beliefs on everyone else.  Maybe they though tell everyone that per capita  it costs 22% more for health care for a vegan than a not vegan because they are not as healthy and more likely to get seriously sick.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,Hahaha stupid vegans. After watching that  I think I'll treat myself to a nice dinner tonight. A medium rare wagnu ribeye  with a side of bacon and cheese stuffed baked potato. Kill 2 animals with one stone.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,This was the most convoluted marketing. He needs forgiveness for eating food? It just doesn't make any sense. Let's do this. PETA is now responsible for feeding every single mouth the world over - every stock animal  every human  and every pet - with kale  hummus  and beets. If they can't  throw them in prison for cruelty and neglect.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,Having lived in Brazil about 5 years ago it is utterly disgusting how much rain forest is being wiped out recently - not because of logging or mining  although that used to play a significant part  but because of the American and European demand for produce. For every acre of rain forest being razed 2 out of 3 acres of newly developed land is being devoted for new farmland to keep up with the profitable vegan trend. Remember this - the plant ripped out by its roots screams as loud as the slaughtered cow  chicken or pig; it's just that the liberals haven't learned to hear those screams yet.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

4xpYBqN6FCs,Farmer Hoggett. Babe and the other farm animals seemed to enjoy their job and it seemed like they were treated quite well. I wonder if farmer Hoggett realizes that he is promoting a company that believes that animals should not be used for anything ever at all. This includes companionship. Peta doesn't think people should own dogs or any type of pet. Farmer Hoggett needs to go back to the farm and stay there.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
4xpYBqN6FCs,This is my opinion... I have the right to say what I want....  I strongly disagree/dislike what PETA's agenda is. If you want to be vegan  good for you! Don't shove your beliefs or theories down my throat. There is truly NO humane way to end an animals life. I do believe that we are a part of this circle of life  and humans are just evolved animals! At the end of the day  my dog will eat me if I died and he can't get food... JS...,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

I understand that using animals for clothes and items is horrible thing  but someone who has been raised in a cell to become a key for advanced technologies is not a bad thing.

WJby1ccWr-I,Sick humans. Humans sure haven't progressed. With all the technology they are getting worse in the ways of wickedness. The holy writings tell us it would be so in the last days for this wicked system. Most people will not learn Gods standards on how we should treat each other and the animals and our beautiful planet he put us on. That's what Jesus said. He said most were on the broad road leading to destruction. He said few were on the road to life. Matthew 7: 13  14. Wildlife dying and massive fish kills all over the globe. Weather extremes people losing  homes and lives due to Blizzards   floods  fires  and  tornadoes.  Our planet has become a garbage dump. God is letting humans see what rulership Without His guidance and obedience to His laws and standards produce. Those that love God and obey Him are promised life on earth. That's in the scriptures but false religion does not teach the truth. They mix a little bible truth with untruths and pagan teachings to confuse. A case of as Jesus said  " the blind leading the blind." Please read the scriptures as not much time left to work on a good relationship with the creator. His name. is Yahweh aka Jehovah. He wants us to know His name. And His son Jesus wants us to know and use His name. John 17: 6 and 26. Gods name is in original. Writings about 7000 times. Man took it out and replaced it with Lord or God. Gods name represented by the vowels  YHWH,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

K0D8UHiHxDM,Please PETA do something for dogs living in Asia as some countries like china  Korea  Vietnam and many more are slaughtering dogs .please help....

kYLMceh2DbU,Living healthy is a privilege for anything alive thanks to many unconcerned.  Humans devalued an animal to being a "$15" life.

They keep cages clean  and there are only a few out of a lot of employees who obviously don't care about the animals (they work as cashiers though obviously lol). I've bought animals there before and they are always healthy and live a long time.

HYnNjqoyySQ,I lived in this town during my HS years and it looks exactly the same and doing exactly the same things with everyone and the familiar places just being older now. Lolli Bros. had a rock band back in the 80's too we used to enjoy out at Long Branch lake beach. I never did go in their sale barn for I didn't own any land or a farm. I wonder if zoo procurement buyers go to Macon?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HYnNjqoyySQ,What the video does not show are the greater percentage of animals are well cared for and treated well. What the video does not show is that a vast majority of the buyers will take these animals and provide a better home and offer a better opportunity to live out their lives. PETA only shows what they want and not the real story. There are a lot of bad things that happen to animals all over the world  but there are other times when PETA does not know what is best for the animals and does what it deems as right without regard for the animal.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HYnNjqoyySQ,Have you been there i have never saw a animal mistreated. I have seen conservation agents there watching. I seen alot of animals treated well. I watch them feed and water each animal.  The zebra and the animals in cages reacting its cause people are near them. I seen alot of animals react when im close to them but are calm when away. Buyers do take care of them and so does sellers. Us elk society meets there before auction. And i see of all the animals this is one less than 1 percent shown. Yes  im against animal abuse . i think peta is trying to reach on this one. But its ok for peta to euthanize animals at no kill shelters ( one of highest rates ). Maybe peta needs to look in their own backyard. I think people need to get out and see and follow the breeders and see for their selves. Yes there are bad breeders but there are alot of good breeders. In Missouri you cant buy a aminal without the right permit if its endangered or native. Conservation agents mo itor activities on this. u have to have the right space and the right conditions before buying anything. Or even getting the right permit.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HYnNjqoyySQ,I wanted to join your channel but after looking at all THOSE silly Hollywood style videos It's all a big fake joke! this is serious matter. this peta crap is just that ! FAKE JOKES.

HYnNjqoyySQ,Please help the animals peta,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HYnNjqoyySQ,I like at the end of that where it says don't buy animals. If people stopped buying animals that means they have to kill the animals otherwise there's no place to put them how stupid can we be. The slaughterhouses by The Animals to make your hamburgers  your pork chops  your steaks  your roast  your bacon  your sausage  your eggs in the morning  your Fried Chicken  need I go on. I know there's some people in here that are so nuts that think that we need to go back to eating bushes. If everyone in the world did that there would not be enough land to raise food for the animals or have any habitat for any animals. Therefore there would not be any animals. Now I'm not condoning mistreating animals but some of the comments in here are so far upside down I can't even say the leaning they're upside down there on their head. That they don't even want to kill an animal for food our food. When it's the natural order of life after all the coyote has to kill for his food. God I hate stupid people. Now the filthy cages in that video yes they need to answer to that. The overcrowded cage they need to answer for it. But in the situation of the paddle to the head to the camel. Would you'd rather have the camel jump over the fence and kill a bunch of people because that is what they was doing they was trying to get the camel out of the ring. And those so-called emaciated cows. Some of those look like Calves and most of those was Texas Longhorns which are a very thin cow anyway. You can feed them 200 bushels of corn as day and they would still look like that because they only eat so much. That is just the breed there is nothing wrong with them. This is what happens when you get here. Making your nose in the agriculture that has no idea how a cow it's supposed to live. I grew up on a farm if you do not use a stick to Corral your cattle then you will get hurt. That cow does not understand go in that hole. Now as far as the Emu I have no idea because I've never been around a emu. So I'm going to do what everyone here should do in that case keep my mouth shut because I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm only commenting on what I know about.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

m4GN75nNFOs,(PLEASE READ THE WHOLE COMMENT BEFORE HATING ON ME) i think peta has good ideas and they only mean to help  but i think they need to talk about the fact that the world cannot survive without meat. there are people who want to go vegan or at the least vegietarian but cant because their bodies need meat. my friend for example wants to go vegan so bad but cant. their body is built so if they stop eating meat they will throw up and be in a lot of pain. they cannot go vegan or they will suffer. if the world was to suddenly all go vegan a lot of people would be in pain. i think if the whole world was to go vegan  there would have to be some kind of medical meat for those people. i think peta needs to make a video about how people who cannot go vegan for medical reasons and how they can help. if you are still reading and you havent gone to hate on me in the replies to this comment  thank you.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
m4GN75nNFOs,Well I despise PETA in some ways  I like how they care for animals so they are not treated inhumanely but I am against the killing of animals and preventing dairy products for people. We NEED protein for our bodies  not just eating plants. Also  they ruined circuses that had animals living in quality lives  seriously the Ringling Bros circus! I am mostly upset at this organization  they don't get how animals and nature work and get this: ANIMALS KILL EACH OTHER!! WTF is all about humans not being able to eat animals?

How many times do I have to say this but crying and emotion is not going to get you far  especially in a different culture  they see animals differently.   I look through the eyes of others all the time and I see allot of ignorance by these elephant 'trainers' (why is this still even a sport still?). They're training them with fear.. That's never a good idea because they're bigger (and probably smarter) than these people. This will also make the not want to preform because they accociate it with pain and it will lead to more fear. I don't wish death on the people only an idiot with no forethought (looks disappointedly at comment section) says  'kill the human' because then they're going to kill the animal.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

EO0DCHY33Yg,Texas has Mohair farms mostly in Edwards Plateau. So why not find folks who treat their goats well instead of just not having Mohair goats? Clipping the hair isn't harmful. It is stupid to mistreat your goats or not provide them proper shelter and care. Bad for business and bad for goats. Rather than trash the entire industry  then why not encourage purchase of mohair from farms that treat goats with proper husbandry?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
EO0DCHY33Yg,Not every shearing activity is as painful and inhumane like the one shown on the video. I think these are few isolated incidences and should be addressed separately. If people stop using mohair products  it'll be equally as cruel/inhumane when goats  being very sensitive to heat  have to carry heavy fleece due to not being sheared. If we attribute this to the mohair industry at large  what's next? Are going to ban wool production as well due to some few farmers' malpractices that should be looked at separately? These people doing these activities should be charged and their actions should not affect others who still get the fleece off the goat without cruelty.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

EO0DCHY33Yg,The cruelty in this video is shocking!  However  does it mean that this cruelty happens at ALL the Angora goat farms in SA?  Mohair is the end product of Angora goats  like wool is from sheep.  Carrying a goat kid or a lamb by the front legs  is done all over the world and is not cruel if done properly.  How many goat backs are broken during shearing sessions?    Were these incidents of cruelty reported to the concerned parties and organisations(Animal anti cruelty/SPCA/Agri SA/CMW) in South Africa BEFORE a ban on mohair was requested?  How about providing the name of the farm and farmer (naming and shaming) in the video BEFORE the entire mohair industry is smeared? It would appear that some dead goats were photographed during a  disastrous drought  or after an unexpected snow storm. I am not a farmer or Angora breeder  but a South African who has been to farms where these cruel atrocities DO NOT happen!!!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

EO0DCHY33Yg,Armageddon is coming soon . Gods war against all evil. The creator is well aware of all who torture and abuse animals. The only hope for all individuals is repentance from things God hates. Do you not think God hates to see his creation tortured mutilated and thrown away like garbage. ? Our Father in the heavens "LET YOU KINGDOM COME " so your will can be done on earth as it is in heaven." A Great Tribulation for the whole planet is facing all mankind which will end with Gods final war against all who ignore His laws and standards. That war is the battle of Armageddon.  Our planet is being  raped   everything on earth is suffering from mans misuse of earth resources. Everything on earth is hurting   humans and  animals.Profit  that's the bottom line for this wicked system at any cost. Kill and mutilate humans and animals Dosent matter to those who are controlled by the demons. Mine for all the prescious gems they can extract . Frack our planet to death gas and  oil spills continue all over the earth. So much more horrible things are being done to this planet. Truly Jesus was right when he said Satan was the ruler of this world aka system . John 12: 31 and 1 John 5: 19 the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. Satan has built up this global system and blinded humans to the truth. 2 Corinthians 4: 4.  The demons have also twisted Gods word of truth and added pagan teachings and mixed the truths Jesus taught that leads to life with lies to mislead people from the path that leads to life.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

YZIwNws71wU,Hey PETA how is that lawsuit of you guys going up to someone's porch taking their dog then killing it less than 24 hours later then lying to the family telling them you had nothing to do with it until they told you they had you guys on camera? I heard the trial was to take place this year not sure if it's still ongoing. How can you call this a nightmare but not the fact that you took someone's dog who had a great home from it's family and owners consider dogs to be family then in a matter of hours killing it. You guys are real monsters i have never seen anyone abuse animals quite like peta does. They have killed more than %86 of the animals they have taken in most get killed within 24 hours of PETA taking them in. My dog shelter which PETA has labeled a "Kill Shelter" does not kill the dog unless it is aggressive and unsafe or it does not find a home within 6 months and if they still have room they will not euthanize the dog until they run out of space. Unlike PETA who kills the dogs they take in within a matter of hours if not minutes then dumps their bodies in random trash cans or off the side of the road how curl. I always give a dog or any animal who dies even ones i have accidentally hit with my car a proper burial. PETA can't be bothered to even give them a fighting chase to find a home. Even my local "kill shelter" puts ads out in the paper to try to get the dogs they have under their care a home Not PETA they can't be bothered it's like you guys drive around and say oh there is a dog at someones house let's take it when the owners not looking and kill it like a psychopath. How disturbing and they call people who eat meat disturbing.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
YZIwNws71wU,Oh you guys didn't kill it like the other 36 000 animals you have killed since 1998 i'm so happy. That dog is super lucky seeing how since 1998 PETA has killed 85.8% of the animals they have taken in. My local dog shelter only kills around %8 of the dogs they have taken in last year while PETA killed 71.9%. If i was a dog i wouldn't want to be anywhere near PETA that is worse than betting your life on a flip of a coin. Not to mention the over %90 they killed in 2010.  Really PETA does your bloodlust know no bounds?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

6SxoCLnCbXg,Hi PETA. I'm not a vegetarian nor a vegan  but  I can't deny that I'm aware of animal cruelty and my contribution towards it due to my choice of nutritional intake. I'm not sure I'm personally strong enough to stop eating meat after having enjoyed doing so for so many years; if I can't quit smoking  I can't quit meat. I do think one day the world will be vegan  perhaps in 100-200 years from now  and people in the future will look back on us meat-eaters much the same as we would look at cannibals.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

LDogmLxGviw,PETA keeps putting out videos on shit they don't understand  yes  their are times when animals are abused  but it's no where near as common as it's made out to be  and a lot of the things that are claimed as cruelty aren't really  it's just people misunderstanding what's actually going on. The worker that "stepped on the sheep's head" was actually just holding the sheep's head out of the way  not resting his wait on it  same with the shearer who was "resting his full wait on the sheep"  most of his wait is either on his left foot  or on the right foot behind the sheep  he is just using his knee to hold the sheep down.  Cuts are often sown up without painkillers  buts it's better than the alternative of leaving the wound open to get infected. Sheep are pretty tough animals  often they won't even flinch when being sown up  also in more serious wounds  disinfectants are usually applied  which often an numbing effect added to them.  Having pretty much grown up on a wool farm and in the shearing sheds  and being an amateur shearer myself  when animal rights groups like peta try and make agricultural industry's out to be trying to be cruel to the animals in just Stinks of bull shit  yes  the main foucus on the animals is that they are profitable  but the welfare of the animals very often goes hand in hand with that  I.e. A healthy sheep in good nick will produce a much better fleece than and sick batters up sheep.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

J5i4cAw--gY,uuuh...didn't you hear about the guy who ran into his burning house to save his dog? when he came out  he got arrested  but hey  at least the little doggy is safe and happy  right? That's what matters right? look it up. here's the best idea and best way to keep all pets safe  ready to hear it?......DON'T HAVE PETS IN THE FIRST PLACE! many reasons to never have pets  saves money  saves time  you don't have to worry about leaving them in a hot car with the window rolled up  but the greatest reason  you don't have to cry rivers and have heartbreaking meltdowns when they die or get wounded. but hey don't take my advice  the next time there's a massive fire/tsunami/earthquake or tornado  by all means don't take cover or seek shelter  stay behind and comfort your doggy or kitty  because it's all about them  we humans don't matter.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

DGfUU1tuo2A,You're right  the fur/animalmeat industries often abuse animals  and they suffer needlessly. Modern industrial farms are disgusting and any health-conscious person should avoid that food. But do you (vegans) think there's anything wrong with killing a deer  for example  as long as you do so in moderation (only when needed)  respect the animals  and let none of it go to waste? This is how our primitive forebears lived  and survived. How can there be anything wrong with quickly killing your prey  if you respect its life and waste none of it? Killing other animals is not only a human  behavior - all secondary consumers do this. That is to say  it's a fundamental aspect of life. So surely you're not opposed to the fact that animals (including humans) kill other animals  but only to modern industrial farms that make animals suffer  right?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

XcQOtC2w7m8,You guys I seriously need you to stop believing these people and giving them donations. PETA is for animal rights although they manipulate people to think their for animal welfare because most people want it. Animal rights and welfare are differend. Animal rights is for animals to have the exact same rights as humans so humans cannot interfeir with animals  so they cannot have pets. I have no problems with animal rights because everyone has their own opinions and its valad. I actually agree with most the things they say. I am okay with an organisation to voice their opinions but what people don't understand is that peta is lying about saving animals. Anytime they get their hands on ANY animal it gets killed (euthanize) to get rid of the population of domestic animals. Peta and other organizations have STOLEN precious family pets and KILLED THEM. The pets were perfectly healthy and HAPPY. I know this is illegal although NOBODY can fight PETA in court because their such a huge organisation that has lots of money from donations  they also manipulate the court to think the animal was sick. They close animal hospitals so they can euthanize Family pets that were curable. Peta doesn't use money to help animals they use it to fight animal rights laws  euthanasia and euthanasia laws and court issues. I am so tired of peta manipulating the public.

PP9Otgc0wq8,Ban the Mutants  terrible maulings to innocents all across the globe. Google 'Pitbull attacks' and see for yourself. If you HATE your children's beautiful faces  adopt one today!  Bully Breeds: Specifically those breeds that have a genetic tendency to 1. Give no warnings- are enacted to attack by sheer movement- unprovoked. 2. Repeatedly bite  maul and shake for the sheer genetic thrill of destroying their target. 3. Cannot be controlled/called off by their handlers. 4. Those breeds that have the mandible that features enlarged muscles  that causes their bites to 'affix' to the muscular depth of the victim.

PSTi5CZXu98,Lol funny video,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
PSTi5CZXu98,PETA is well known for faking videos  making up stories that is just a lie and killing healthy animals they get into their "care". It is all about making themselves famous and getting money. They don`t really care about the animals and they have overlooked animal cruelty in movies they get paid for to supervise and similar over and over.  The video above is a good example of  PETA lies  after a sledge hammer in the head the animal is unconscious (feeling nothing if done correctly)  and it is very similar to the method used by all slaughters in the west using a bolt gun to do the same. Strange thing is that it is easy to find videos of REAL animal cruelty but PETA uses fake ones... I think they use fake ones on purpose because like all scammers they want to reach the people that are stupid and don`t think as they are the most easy targets for scamming.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

Why do they even allow tourists to use innocent animals? Can't they see the way the're being treated? Couldn't they have some sort of tents with food and water to put the animals in when ur not riding/leading/driving/hitting/kicking/ripping the mouthes off of them?

OmpRKRy-JL8,Why would you blurr out the faces of the people who were beating the animals? We need to KNOW who they are so we can report them for animal abuse!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
OmpRKRy-JL8,Admit it you PETA people: The White race  and especialy Western Europeans  are really the only people of this earth who even care at all about animal rights. And so it makes sense that the whole animal rights movement in its totality was born with the National Socialist Savitri Devi and her immortal book 'Impeachment of Man'. There is NO other book that is so comprehensive in its scope of what all this movement encompasses. It is the bible..the very birth of animal rights. And it was published in 1959. Savitri Devi CANNOT be ignored. If you ignore her  you are wallowing in ignorance and hypocrisy. So for those of you who are liberals  and are not afraid to go outside that modern liberal box of thinking  I urge you to get a copy of 'Impeachment of Man'. It won't disappoint. Also  the first government regime in the world to outlaw vivisection and enforce jail terms for people who committed animal cruelty was none other than Hitler's Germany. The following paragraph is from the book 'Impeachment of Man' by Savitri Devi (1959): Yet  along with the apparently healthy condition of the horses he meets in the streets  there is one thing that cannot but favorably impress a lover of animals on his arrival in England or Germany  and that is the special care generally given in those countries to cats and dogs. I shall never forget the sight that greeted me on a cold November night of 1945  as I walked out of Victoria Station in London  coming from India: a magnificent  panther-like cat  fiery yellow with tawny stripes  fat and glossy  his tail erect; an animal accustomed to be loved  that was not afraid of human beings  but came at once when I called him. I took him up in my arms. How heavy he was! I thought of the dozens and dozens of miserable starving cats which I used to feed in India; of the hundreds and thousands that have remained out of my reach: of all the creatures  all over the world  that are born  live and die without knowing a human caress. And tears fell from my eyes as I stroked the soft  thick  royal  furry creature that purred and purred in response to my touch. And - although I had  on ideological grounds  actively fought against her during the war - I blessed England from the depth of my heart  "Whatever be their rulers - or those who sit and 'pull the strings' at the back of these - HER PEOPLE  of overwhelmingly Nordic stock  are thorougly good " thought I.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

I would join you in support if I really thought the use of these animals was inappropriate  that the suffering was needless or excessive.  I don't.  I welcome anyone to provide oversight  express concern  but know that medical researchers also love animals  and care about their well being.  We're not monsters  and we're also carefully watching animal research for needless cruelty or unethical conduct.

C0GS2tC4oSM,I'm glad you idiots felt the need the protest the graduation of the Dwight Look College of Engineering instead of the Veterinary Medicine graduation. Even though the entire premise for your protest was unjustified and is riddled with false claims  your pathetic organization does not even have the mental capacity to protest the correct ceremony. Instead  future aircraft designers  car manufacturers  rocket scientists  and computer programmers had to waste even a minute of their momentous day to watch this buffoonery unfold. This organization prides itself with protecting animals while it murders dogs and cats without hesitation. Thanks  and go gig yourselves,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,You interupted in the wrong neighborhood,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,Well  for the naysayers this is typically how protests are done. You're going to bother a lot of people and ruffle some feathers.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,This is why people hate vegans,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

C0GS2tC4oSM,lmao why protest the engineering graduation about stuff you claim the vet college is doing,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,I applaud this person for wanting to get the message across but this is NOT the way! The vegan community disowns him!!,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,Why would they protest how stupid their own members are?,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,(Vegan myself) This was a shitty move peta. I like peta for the information and the message but not what they do with it. People like you are why vegans/vegetarians are hated so much. We're seen as prissy and stuck up. We're seen as annoying and pushy. This is not how you spread a message  this is not how you educate people. This is not okay.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

C0GS2tC4oSM,This is so fucking disrespectful,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,This is why people dislike vegans and vegetarians - I'm a vegetarian myself and I think such behaviour is not the way to spread a message. I actually find this embarassing and just wrong,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,I thought this was fine until the guy came out. They should've just had the big sign that didn't cause that much disruption,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,Great job peta show those idiots what is right,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,this was good time to protest  well deone PETA I hope every one got the massage  keep up good job,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
C0GS2tC4oSM,As a vegan I can say this is wrong and embarrassing.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

You know it's easy to care when you are the victim but it takes special people to put themselves on the line to protest violence and cruelty against others  especially when the others can't speak for themselves. Go PETA - you are right to fight for animals and a compassionate world. Those poor dogs and all animals in laboratories have a true friend in you. May you be victorious.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

xyCiQNTMy3E,A substrain of Golden Retrievers actually have the same MD as children do and veterinary and human medical researchers have been studying these dogs for the purposes of developing treatments and cures for both the dogs themselves and children.  These dogs are fragile and are loved and very carefully cared for during their lives.  There was a colony at the Vet School at Cornell and these dogs were considered to be very special and precious and lived at home with the researchers rather than in the vet school.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

Did u know that people were originally meant to eat meat because we are carnivores too. Plants can also feel things too ya know. The testing of animals is to make medicines that can help people's lives and you guys complained about the animals.The next thing u are gonna accuse someone of is rescuing an animal. Like animal shelters across the globe. My point is is that you guys kill animals too. Weather you realize it or not animals die in the wild too...,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

wCASZjRtJ_E,Want to hear funny PETA  I'm in the Alt-right and I agree with about 90% of your stances and goals.  Odd are you'd disavow someone like me but you need to realize that animal "rights" or the ethical treatment of animals is an explicitly white thing.  You only need to look to the rampant animal abuse in non-white countries to understand this and yes I get that there are white scum bags just as bad but they don't exist in the sheer number that non-white animal abusers do.

We NEED protein for our bodies  not just eating plants. Also  they ruined circuses that had animals living in quality lives  seriously the Ringling Bros circus! I am mostly upset at this organization  they don't get how animals and nature work and get this: ANIMALS KILL EACH OTHER!! WTF is all about humans not being able to eat animals?

mIeIhn_DmeY,Cool. I need this video because I won't eat another egg again until 2020 or until I get my own farm. On my farm both sexes will live and will be sent to farm sanctuaries ( most of them). The same thing goes with my future sheep  goats and dairy cows. Speaking of dairy cows  on my future farm the dairy calves will get the mother's milk first. We'll just be getting the leftovers. I'll be separating the mother from the calf  but only until the calf immune system builds up. It will be for a month and 1 day. Will I AI them? Nope since that I'm going to be working with miniature cattles  I don't need to use AI. I don't see AI as rape  but kinda gross. However  bulls are dangerous ( miniature bulls are easier to work with and are less dangerous from what I've read )  so why can see  some farms use AI. Change of plan. I will have to seprate the mothers from the calves even longer. Sorry vegans and ARA  but I done more research on why calves are taken way from thwor mothers. You guys need to google "why are calves taken away from their mothers" too. It has nothing to do with so we can have all the milk ( I'm farming for a hobby anyway ). Okay I'll give at least one reason. I've read that calves will butthead or bite the mother's teats to get more milk and dairy cows have sensitive udders and teats. I do wish there was a better way.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

HXlfn4uIDm8,Veganism does not help animals. Because  PETA  you are ignorant. Not all chickens are abused. It is perfectly humane to have your own or support REAL free range farms and eat their eggs. As long as they have a nutritionally valuable diet and educated owners  their eggs are HUMANE. One company does NOT speak for them all. There are thousands of real free range farms  that need supporting. It is extremely popular to own backyard chickens and this should be a supported practice. Not your vegan bullshit.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HXlfn4uIDm8,And its most of my diet and one of my favorite foods,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HXlfn4uIDm8,I wish I can but my parents will KILL me,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HXlfn4uIDm8,no bitch no,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HXlfn4uIDm8,Okay  now that I get the whole point of this video  I'll now explain it.  Last year  in my Home Economics class  there were some people who visited our school to explain about how the chickens are kept and how they're taken care of. They're in free-range farms  yes  but they're allowed to run around freely outside during daytime. It's only during nighttime that they're going back into the barn  and the next day they're releases again to run around the grass field.  Plus  they also brought some chickens and chicks as well to show us  and they looked absolutely fine! No plucked feathers  no wounds  nothing! The chickens were very huge and plump  and their plumage was very smooth. It was a sign that they're healthy.  Same with the juveniles  and the newborn chicks (juveniles looked a bit scruffy but they're still healthy).  Even if these chickens did go back inside the barn  it's only when they sleep. They weren't crammed like that or anything. If they were  they wouldn't have looked so healthy.  I don't know where this community have investigated  but please keep in mind that not all farms are like that. In Canada  the rules against animals are a bit strict and I bet they won't allow the farms to treat animals like this at all. Don't demonize every single farms  please.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
HXlfn4uIDm8,While i will never go vegan  i still think people should give as much respect to animals as police dogs. again i will never go vegan  but i think animals should ALWAYS have a ton of access  to the outside world  even if there is a fence blocking them from escaping and be killed with euthanaisa as that is probably the most humane way to do it.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta

I had to stay at the dining room until i finished everything. This was at a Convent called St. Agathas   in Rockland County. Now  at age 58  I've spent years  just eating only veggie dishes. I've loved animal's at a young age. I had my Shetland Pony  named Ivanhoe  for three years. He was killed outside the barn  by some really bad boys  at the Convent.

ClnrE30xsnU,Good lord y'all are super annoying. Yes it is often unethical to test things on dogs and other Animals  but bitching to the schools won't solve anything. The FDA and other Federal inspection agencies require companies to go through multiple levels of testing to get a product allowed on the market. Martin Shkreli (The man I'm sure you all hate) was even quoted saying that he hated that he had to do testing on dogs  but the government required that he do it.

ClnrE30xsnU,i don't think we make animals our slaves  it's the animals that make US humans the slave to them  think about it  it's humans that must feed water  change litterboxes  walk the dogs  give them baths  give them pet treats  take them to the vet if needed  play with them  tell me "peta" who is the real slave here? for entertainment  we would have very little family films  we would never have lord of the rings  no westerns  i don't even think we would have tribbles from star trek  cause they are fluffy and cute  even if they weren't real. you might even be crazy enough to hate on animated animal movies such as nearly anything made by Disney.i even heard you had a beef with mario and his flying coon outfit. *stupid as stupid does i guess* as for experimenting  Well that is a hit or miss really. good to get much needed cures and items for cleaning ourselves  *in your case  smell ya later* but they really shouldn't be poking rats and monkey. what we need are peta members to do all experiments on instead  for what better than humans to try and create things for humans  right? so i ask all peta members willing  go out to the scientific places  free the animals and take thier place instead! now for the part of wearing animal skin  whatever.I'll wear that cow  bunny dog or whatever else there might be  and if you throw blood on my nice jacket  I'll take your skin and wear you instead. so don't even think about it. remember what happen to peta on southpark? that was probably the best episode ever.,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),officialpeta
