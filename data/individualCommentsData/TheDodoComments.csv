i38x4-AU20E,My last dog was like this but not to me my son! She was a keeshound and she HATED men (we think she was beaten with a hose by men for most of her 3 years before us)... she almost took my dads hand off the first few months. She barked  snarled and generally hated men. My son was born when she was 7 or 8 and from the minute he was awake she was laying in the doorway to my room  she was with him. She taught him how to walk  run and play. She didn't like my (now ex) husband to touch him she would snarl and bark right in his face. When night time came she laid in the doorway again until sun up. When she died he was devastated  that was 5 years ago and he STILL talks about her. My sister has a dog that treats him almost like that but she is friendlier and plays.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,wow she looks like a dead ringer of mine,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,so incredibly sweet!  what a wonderful sweet precious dog!!   It seems that sometimes atleast.....that guardian angels come in all shapes sizes and even species huh!!? lol,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dogs need a "job"...  a purpose.  Gemma made taking care of the kid her purpose  then the kitten.   You have to give your dog a "job" they will be much happier.  Even if it just walking their human.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,These are fun videos  but with the pit bull ones  you can't fully enjoy the good feeling aspect of it.. because there's a corner of your mind that remembers reading story after story after story about pits seeing the kid as din-din  all of a sudden.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Typical pit in my opinion.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,This makes me so mad i had female blue pit she was such a good dog but she also was a jealous dog an overly protective she was my brothers dog at first she did have aggresive problems she wasnt trained mean abused or anything but she did have a mean side to who she didnt kno at all which i liked then didnt like so my brother took her to pound to get rid of her so i went an paid to get her out an took her with me cause i loves her she had been a good dog friend for me for three yrs but her aggresin was bad tho i had to take my other dog to vet cause she ripped his naked open it was a fight she started then my duaghter was born an we took her home an the dog still showed aggresin towards my daighter a baby infant i had to get rid of her just sucked cause she was a good family dog but was only good to who grow up with her as puppy i think somw dogs a just naturally have tht aggreshin in them not say a pit thing at all some dogs act tht way some dont but videos just makes me mad wish i coukda had my duaghter grow up with the pit i had like this but couldnt trust her when broughter her home,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Adorable,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dog-God send guardian angel for every human being,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,It's past midnight and I'm going to bed  with a melted-on-the-floor heart!!!!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,thats a real special dog. Your all so lucky!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,I hope Gemma and the rest of your family is doing great  she is a lovely dog. It is the owners who gives pit bulls a bad reputation.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pure love guardian angel from above,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dogs are so much better than us humans.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pitbull=perfect human companion/protectors,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Boo..to the people who gave this video a thumbs down....love pit bulls..they get such a bad reputation,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,All very very nice ... mummy and all.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Love this video. I have a brindle  male 3 years old my kids love him to death. Pitt Bulls best dog genuine loving big babies.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Gemma has codependency issues,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Awesome:),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,lil misty right about now :),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Did you know pit bulls are actually the nicest dog in the world  there are more nice pit bulls than other dogs that are nice. I hate that people think they are bad they are actually the nicest dog in the world.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,So sweet. Gemma has a good mom and brother.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Awwwwww i almost cried that was so sweet and the mom os sooo beautiful,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Nanny dog indeed.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,See people!! Not all pitbulls are dangerous dogs. Back then they were known as the nanny dogs,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,My dogs name is Gemma and she is a pit bull,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,What a sweet vid. Pit bulls are so misrepresented. They are kind and gentle. Will they protect your family  Hell ya. What has happened is pit bulls are a big dollar item. They get inbred  so assholes can make money. The number 1 cause of dog bites in North America is the way any dog is raised. Number 2 is inbreeding. Rest my case.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,A complete happy family. Superb.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,I lost my best friend a year and a half ago. He was 20  even though he wasn't human  he was a soulmate. I love you and miss you  everyday buddy. I miss all the snuggles and kisses and watching you grow. You will be with me forever,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,A risk I would never ever take. Pit Bulls are completely unpredictable around babies and small children. Google "pit bull attacks baby " and you will find literally hundreds of stories and maimed and killed babies and small children. In many of the articles  the parents say they could not believe it as the dog was always so caring etc. What you are doing is actually illegal in the UK.   I'm not writing this just to be judgemental but to warn you and others not to do this. You are playing with fire  google what these dogs do to children. I cannot understand why anyone would take this risk.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,How could anyone dislike this!?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,We don't deserve such wonderful pitbulls.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Got me tearing up in this truck stop Damn! Thanks for the video.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,fake,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,It's nurture over nature. Pitties get an insanely bad rep.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Mom looks like Sandra Bullock.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,The only thing that makes pitbulls agressive are the people who own them with my uncle being a veterinarian i got know dogs of different breeds and you would think the scariest looking dogs would be agressive when its the exact opposite they are just big babies its sad that human kind created a bad stigma for certain dogs because of peoples actions.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,I'm sorry but that dog was licking the babies mouth that's disgusting,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,My apartments don't allow pit Bulls no German Shepherds no rottweilers . I have Great Pyrenee now but soon I'm moving to my new house .I'm going to adopt one of those breed ..,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,R.I.P Gemma...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,I want to heart this video!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pits are great loyal dogs!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pit Bulls are AMAZINGLY AWESOMETASTIC LITTLE PEOPLE!!! GOD BLESS THE DODO!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dogs are so great to grow up with  but God  dare I say  made a mistake  not letting them live longer. I have owned 9 dogs and remember everyone. Is this that DANGEROUS breed I hear so much about  I can see why!!!(Kidding my last was a Pit Bull who I LOVED everyday I had her). My son picked a Jack-Chi  Jack Russel/Chihuahua who I love and has never left my side. ALL DOGS ARE GREAT  too bad people have to get involved!!!    THANKS FOR SHARING  I THINK THE BABY NEDS TO BE CHANGED  never mind it was me!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Just because some pit bulls weren't raised right and are aggressive doesn't mean they all are  People think something that look scary(even though pitbulls usually aren't scary to me..) are scary and vicious animals. There are a bunch of pitbulls that can prove pit bull haters wrong.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,The world should be ruled by dogs..,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dodo i want to say that your channel is the best cute and funniest animal channel i ever saw.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,How to get diabetes: watch this video.   Joking aside  that is a very nice story,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pits were first used as nanny dogs. Also female dogs are born with that maternal instinct. So cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,If I see that fucking dogg I'm gonna blow it's fucking head off and write a fucking tell all about it,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,We have a male (Odin) that looks and acts just like Gemma. He adores all children and loves any attention from them. He also loves our cat and our female lab/pit mix  he loves everyone except for male strangers but he warms up to them once he knows they're not a threat. We're lucky to have him.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,A pitbull needs to act like a lion.. and u ppl made her silly human like woman ??,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,who wants a human when you can have a dog,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Beautiful video,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,No pitbull bad bad,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Very heart warming  but I would be concerned if she perceived a threat from some other person or animal.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,I think the problem with these dogs in not that they're innately violent or vicious. But rather the opposite.   They are too kind  too protective and try to please too much they'd put up with anything from their owner. And therein lies the problem. Other dogs  when they see a threat they bark or chase away. But these pitts  nuh uh.. If they feel their owner is under threat they'd go "YOU ARE DEAD BRO!! D-E-D DEAD!!"...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Pit bulls and Boxers are the best breeds for kids. They are naturally playful!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Cute but a LIL NASTY. Letting a Dog Lick all over your Child  NO!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Wonderful story! :),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,letting a dog lick your kid on the mouth...yug,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Dog: this is my puppy now,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

i38x4-AU20E,Buddies 4 ever,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

i38x4-AU20E,Dogs cant kiss u retarded Idiots...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,Honestly? Idk about this. Might have been luck to have such a good dog  because I've encountered dogs that were jealous of newborns or ones that got irritated by the toddlers' lack of tenderness when they play. Now combine an annoyed dog with jaws of steel and you end up with a dead kid. I don't mind having a pitbull  but I won't trust leaving an animal this strong with a fragile kid. It only takes one bite.. Cute vid tho  wish you guys the best,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
i38x4-AU20E,My Staffy  Lexie and I had the exact same bond  my family adopted her a week before my mum found out she was pregnant with me so I grew up with my best friend by my side. Unfortunately she passed away last year at 17 years of age. A year older than me!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

dVc67LhOCp8,Awwwww,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
dVc67LhOCp8,You both have been Through a lot  and I know the Lord is with you but I want to take a moment and say something about your dog. dogs are our best friends and family  everything. Just thinking back my neighbor's had a black lab like yours and he got sick one day and they kept trying to help him but everything they did he wasn't getting better. they took him to the vet and found out that he had liver failure the doctor- vet gave him medicine to help him get better it took a while before it started helping him. I'm not a vet but when I was younger I wanted to be  So I did some studying and I found out that milk thistle is one of the strongest antioxidant that is good for humans and dogs so I told my neighbor to go to the vet and talk to the vet about putting him on it if it was okay they went to the vet and the vet saidit wouldn't hurt to have him taking it along with the other meds. he had him on.  The dog started improving and getting better he was able to eat a little bit at the beginning on his own  get up and move around almost like his old self.  The vet said they caught in time and and he was improving. I'm not sure what happened only because they  moving across town after that. I believe the vet told them it would have been good for him to have been on this vitamin when he was younger and he probably wouldn't have had this problem.   Labs  some of them have this health  problem so check with your vet and see about this vitamin for your dog because you guys have been through so much and I know you love him a lot and would hate for anything to happen to him after all you've been through.   Best of luck and God's prayers to you all!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

HoFOFK09YTs,It honestly pisses me off  so many people have animals   they give birth   then one of the babies are "deformed" or "not normal" then they either put it down or abandon it when it could actually live a healthy life. That's like saying   "Oh   my kid's ear is bigger than the other   I should get rid of it   or maybe just SLAUGHTER MY OWN CHILD." I DONT CARE IF IT'S JUST AN ANIMAL  IT DESERVES A GOOD LIFE AS MUCH AS A HUMAN! I honestly can't stand those kinds of people   so inconsiderate. Thank you for being good people.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

ALL animal life is valuable  regardless of disability or deformities. My vet would have NEVER said that! Would you kill your human child because of that  I think not.

5S1IMAHjC-8,this is cruel..,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
5S1IMAHjC-8,look im not trying to hate but the Japanese and other countries eat exotic animals and is not fair! They capture dolphins kill them and eat them what kind of sick sickos! Poor dogs are breed and tortured their whole lives and then tortured the worst before being killed and eaten! this is not fair! Humans are killing off the world and the animals that were here before us! Im a human and I hate being one because the things we do to animals and to our own nature!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
5S1IMAHjC-8,This is just horrible they are cute but they aren't for humans to catch and take them away from their family by the way love this man he has such a warm soul,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

5S1IMAHjC-8,thank you sweet man  this literally makes my soul heart and you my good man have courage and patience  I on the hand would have definitely tried to fight and save that poor dolphins pleading for salvation  and most likely would have been thrown in jail  unfortunately the way to make  faith in humanity is to take the human part out  my apologies for your burden <namaste>,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

5S1IMAHjC-8,When I was little  my dad would always go to the Dolphinarium with me.. That's an aquarium for sea creatures in the Netherlands  I always thought that the dolphins felt happy there... The people would sometimes rescue sick dolphins and make them better. Sometimes let them free  sometimes keep them. One time there was an Orca who was injured  they put them in a gigantic aquarium (probably small for him)  and people would look at him and take pictures. But they set him free.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
5S1IMAHjC-8,The fact that dolphins look like humans (with their mind and feelings)  makes it even worse! They feel more grief than other animals and know what's going to happen at that moment... Those beautiful creatures look depressed in the aquarium and it's heartbreaking,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
5S1IMAHjC-8,I hate the hunters I really really hate them,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

de35k3po36M,Last night i was sleeping in my bed at 11 PM and i heared footsteps coming from my attic  there was 2 cats fighting that it disturbed my sleep. I was so pissed and after a few seconds one cat fell off the attic towards my bedroom  i was shocked! I was afraid to capture the cat because it might hurt me so what i did is to hit him with a stick  hitting the cat on his head. I feel guilty for the cat but i have no choice but to injure the cat to be able to catch him. After a few minutes i finally got him and was decided to throw it in the valley  i was so sad about what i did to the cat. After watching this video i realized that i must love the cats.

NvLAZpvh9VU,When squirrels eat they're cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
NvLAZpvh9VU,What is the formula made from? I'll take a stab it contains cows milk. If it does then stealing baby calf milk and giving it to a baby squirrel is like borrowing off Peter to pay Paul  it makes no sense. Using cows like a machine to feed other animals while their babies are taken and killed is wrong.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
NvLAZpvh9VU,She isn't completely raising them. She's just doing what their mothers would do in the wife. Growing them up so they can be released adult squirrels.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

Continue the good work,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
NvLAZpvh9VU,I really like that she keeps the squirrels that cannot be released. All too often  rescue organizations just put down the ones that are not able to go back but could adapt to live happy lives in captivity.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

NvLAZpvh9VU,Oh~ This brings back lots of fond memories  squirrels are SO underrated big hearts in small bodies. I used to get inundated every spring with baby animals mostly kittens... lots of kittens. But Ive raised everything from opausoms  racoons an even a coyote pup that was rescued as a "puppy". But squirrels have some of the most expressive tails in the animal kingdom  if you want to know how a squirrel is feeling just look at their tail. Ah its been years but I STILL are finding nuts stashed round my houce till this day and it makes me smile every time I find one.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

XTU3-UlQubQ,Thank you for adopting Smokey and finding a home for Wiley!!  You are awesome!!  I'm a crazy cat lady (with 3 rescues) - who absolutely adores pit bulls and bully breeds.

XTU3-UlQubQ,Wish more ppl adopted but also that there was passed laws that ppl who throw out dogs get banned 4 life from ever owning any animal aswell as jailtime and fines. And ppl who chain up dogs to fight or breed to earn money and the dogs suffer get jailed 4 a long time,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

pPmNrovsdqk,Kicker is booter reborn as the same kinda doggo,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Maybe his dog was reborn,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Thank you for sharing this video. I lost my best friend on New Year's Eve this past winter. The end of 2017 was a brutal stretch for me  from my mother being diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in August(she is in remission now) to me suffering a gruesome knee injury that required emergency surgery at the beginning of December. But losing Deuce was the most devastating of all because he was ALWAYS there for me during my previous rough times. He helped me get through so many tough moments and when I had to put him down  I lost it. I fell into a dark  dark place that I didn't see anyway to get out. It still is so painful  I miss him so much. He was that once or twice in a lifetime dog and I had the exact same bond with him as you did with Booter. We did EVERYTHING together when he was younger and I still loved him just as much when he got older and couldn't be as active anymore. What has helped so much with the healing process is watching videos like this and realizing that other people share the same kind of bond with their dog(s). I will eventually get another dog because there are so many of these amazing animals that need homes. Until then  I will be enjoying  and yes crying  to these videos. God bless.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

pPmNrovsdqk,Maybe booter is Kicker  or not. I'm over here thinking of a Dog's Purpose.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Noooo. Not Booter :(,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,*B A B Y N U G G E T*,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,RIP botter,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,I kinda believe booter came back as kicker or booter lives on inside kicker...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Terrific Video  Keep up the good work!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,i always believe in fate..that even tho he lost his beloved Booter..that fate sent Kicker into his life..not to replace him but to heal h is heart..im sure Booter will always be a part of his heart..beautiful story..made me tear up..esp when he said Booter died ias he held him in his lap,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,I believe Booter ask an Angel to be by Andrew's side. And Kicker was born to be with him.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,There is nothing like a dog to quell a broken heart.  Size  age or breed is not important because dogs "know" exactly what their beloved  human needs or wants.  For my entire life of 80 years so far except for about 6 month of supreme misery  I've always had at least 1 dog  and I can truthfully say life is dull  boring  and devoid of true companionship without a dog by my side (or in my bed - LOL).  May Andrew and Kicker have many happy healthy adventuresome times together.  Thanks to Dodo for continuing to illustrate the true value of human/dog relationships.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Glad Andrew found Kicker!! Happy travels  to you both! Stay safe.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Yikes  what a tearjerker but great story!  Hope these two go on many  many adventures together for a long time!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Wait....what fucking job does he have where he can take a 6 month roadtrip to Alaska  and how can I be down?!?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,I understand what he's going through too I lost my dog on March 30 this year due to an enlarged heart  it has made me vow to never love another dog again but hopefully that can change.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,A Dog's Purpose is what I think of whenever I rewatch this!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,Yet  another great story. Thanks Dodo. These stories are very uplifting. We all need some reassurance in humanity from time to time.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pPmNrovsdqk,maybe I cried maybe I didn't...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

rdVgHzfl_kk,Thanks for sharing this lovely story. We all have that special fur baby  fur-friend or fur soulmate we love. Mine is a goofy fawn Pug/Shih tzu cross  she's my constant companion  my fur-friend and guarder of all my secrets. She waits for me to give the last bit of my toast - not that I should give her too much. You know the old story...once over the gums  forever on the 'tums' hahaha! We walk most week days  rain or shine. But I do allow her free will! If she runs and hides under the dinning room table  this older chick isn't bending down or even crawling after her. Free will my arse  lazy cow me more like it!  I only have her as my bud and at 7 nearly 8  she should be here till she's at least 12-15 fingers crossed. Love her heaps but she'll be my last. I love to travel and my family moan far too much about this that and the other in regards to watching over her while I'm away. They like but she's my buddy  not theirs as I'm reminded every so often. Thanks again...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

QcdrRkz8T14,Ah  this story did my heart good.  I said goodbye to my 13 yr old "village dog" last month  and feel like I will never love another like her again. But this makes me think I could possibly again.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
QcdrRkz8T14,These ppl are awesome! My next dog will be a rescue thanks to watching the Dodo and seeing all these amazing dogs that need homes! I can say i have purchased my last dogs  i have had 2 rescue dogs b4 my chihuahuas bcuz i wanted a small dog and i got 2.. brother and sister that have never spent a day apart. They are now 8 and hopefully have plenty of years ahead of them but without a doubt a rescue is for me and i wud have one now but everything is about $. I thought having small dogs would help with that but my female chihuahua has diabetes and i never thought dogs could be this expensive  but no doubt she is worth every penny and more! Dogs are the best part of being a human,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
QcdrRkz8T14,A beautiful  woman with a golden heart---YOU ARE AN ANGEL AND GOD BLESS YOU.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
QcdrRkz8T14,Beautiful story,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
QcdrRkz8T14,This is another example of the Love of God. Anyone who comes to the aid of anyone or animal in distress or pain has the Love of God in them. God gives life and more abundantly. God is LOVE. God so loved the world  he gave his only son Jesus to die for our sins that whosoever believes in him will never die but have everlasting life in Heaven. Jesus is the Truth  the life and the way. The ONLY way to Heaven. If you know the Truth  it will set you free from the bondage of Satan. Satan kills steals and destroys. Satan is a Liar and Deceiver. Satan is filthy and nasty. Satan hates everybody and wants to take everyone to Hell and torment them forever. Jesus defeated Satan at the Cross. Repent and receive Jesus as your Savior. Make the right choice. I Did. Don't let Satan control you and take you to Hell and torment you forever. You have nothing to lose. Jesus is Lord.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

h3Off9_-mfI,Dogs can instantly change someone's mood!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
h3Off9_-mfI,Awwww........... Wot  a beautiful  baby,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
h3Off9_-mfI,It is good and all that they adopted this cute dog but I can see that he does not have boundaries or had proper training.  It will soon not be cute anymore when he crashes or destroys something they care about. He has alot of energie and yes they walk him and everything but it isn't enough.   Next to that  treating him like a baby isn't the way to go with a dog  especially a dog with that amount of energie.   Not trying to be negative about this family but it is something that dog owners should do to avoid bad behavior. Talking from experience here.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
h3Off9_-mfI,Hehehe,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
h3Off9_-mfI,Well I think much of Marty's fun loving personality comes from his very loving parents!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

8PcV0-rq1SM,Omg I almost cried this is sooo sweet,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Beautiful bond between those two. I wish Daya and Raisin could have stayed together; it became more a great friendship than a mother/puppy thing. But still  great work and caring from all involved in saving these poor lost lives. Dogs really are too good for "us" with all of people's treating them like things to be bred  bought  sold  discarded  etc.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,That's a Horrible thing for a vet to say... What a Jerk...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Shes looks still cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

8PcV0-rq1SM,But what about the first adult dog the puppy bonded with. She was depressed because she didn't have any puppies  and now this puppy was separated from her?! That doesn't seem right. But I am glad  Raisin got a good home with Wonderful people!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Here's local (North Carolina) article on these folks.  The organization that rescued Daya and Raisin is 'Halfway There Rescue'.  I don't understand why this info wasn't included and i am downvoting the video because of this.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,WHAT HAPPENED TO DAYA!?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Dogs/cats do just fine with one eye   or missing a leg   they are amazing animals!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Scars are cool! They show that you went through something and lived to tell the tale. Human or animal  scars are something to be proud of and anyone saying differently has just never experienced a story a scar can tell.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,tears of joy  thanks for being compassionate people,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,I think how it's amazing how Raisin bonded with Daya.. Raisin literally brought Daya out of a depression phase   and it was just so heartwarming seeing Daya just looking after Raisin as if Raisin was her own pup.   It was just so heartwarming  Daya  depressed because none of her pups came  got  to have that motherly instinct with at least one. It was just so nice.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Oof,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,So cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,She is so......BEAUTIFUL,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

8PcV0-rq1SM,This story is great until they break the news that they took raisin from daya after daya had formed a bond with that pup and she once again had that ripped from her. I've rescued  rehibilitated  fostered and rehomed dogs my entire life and this just makes me so sad. They should have gone together.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,when god made animals he should have stopped because as far as i am concerned that is the only thing he got right  they are nothing but the purest love in the world. when he made man is where he went wrong  man is selfish  cruel narcissistic and petty  thank you for sharing your story. you have a beautiful little baby.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
8PcV0-rq1SM,Why didnt someone adopt both dogs together? I wouldn't have ripped them apart! So sad!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

XUBRkPvq3DU,I had a bearded dragon "Ophelia" for 9yrs! She was the best  even slept in my pillow!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Anybody that knows anything about animals knows that reptiles are not cuddly or social. Of course they are smart enough to know where their food comes from and who they're not threatened by. That being said this bearded dragon is seeking out the heat from the keyboard because they are cold-blooded animals; they're not warm blooded they can't regulate their own temperature.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Lol she probably saves her work too much just incase if he/she pressed the wrong button,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,This cat has no hair.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,That is a very sick dragon.  His skin shouldn't be rotten black.  Probably dead by now.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Baby dragon: let meh walk in this thing human That girl: aww...u r so kind to your mom Baby dragon: I like that clicking sound let me- That girl: aww...it ok... Baby dragon: ahhhh....!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Um his beard is black and his head is bobbing that isnt okay hes stressed and or mad,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,If not for sits  why is it warm?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Oooorr maybe hes just hungry and he wants food... So he will annoy you until you put your attention to him,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,My dog love to steal the ramote for the TV,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Adorable!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,The laptop is warm,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Wait  reptiles want to be petted too!? What a world!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Aww how adorable! I frickin love reptiles :),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Not to ruin the cute video but the head bob is a sign for another dragon so he is probably seeing the other dragon in the cage and trying to run towards it. She just sat herself in the way knowing she can get a video  his beard is very black which can be a sign of aggression so he is probably running to another dragon.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,I love animals,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,all animals can be with humans  if raised properly tbh,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,The animal was so funny,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,The reason cats and the lizard do this is because of the warmth being given of by the computer,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,It's warm and they love it. But they also love sleeping/sitting on your chest  I do not know why  mines do it  but I think its cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,he's so cute.. i miss my beardie so much.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Uhh... It just wants the heat from the laptop.  This animal is cold blooded.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Can I get 29 of those,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,*Actually wants to ruin moms career*,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Tad Cooper!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Laptop is warm. It's a cold blooded animal.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,He is trying to get attention XD,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,lol  I love bearded dragons  but just like when a cat does that  it's a display of dominance. I never had a dominance issue with the bearded dragon I was familiar with  but the impression I got from him was that the social behavior is no different than any other animal - respect rules boundaries and limitations - be firm be consistent be calm.  I mean in this case the computer is the disputed point  presumably because he wants to bask there - if you're not confident dealing with the social interaction  I'm sure he'd be happy if you chucked him up on your shoulders or in your hoodie or something  give an alternative warm spot  but do it immediately once the interaction begins - if you're not consistent it's just disrespectful to the animal  shows you don't respect them as an individual... I don't know if bearded dragons actually build impressions like that  but I've always been impressed by their social ability.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,That lizard is PISSED.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,:') So cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,I have a Beardie name Spiky!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,So...why does he bob his head? Is it a sign of aggression?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,It was really mad it has a black neck,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,I love beardies!! their so cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Why did his beard turn black?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,The dragon is just head bobbing at the other lizard in the cage as a show of dominance and the laptop happens to be in the way. Sorry to burst your bubble lol,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,looks like a nice rock to bathe on,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,I thought I saw something on this channel recently saying not to keep exotic reptiles as pets?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Laptop warm VS Angry at screen. Take your bets ladys and gentlemen.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,When their necks are black like that doesn't it mean they are mad or unhappy,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,AWESOME,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

XUBRkPvq3DU,She's probably just wants a spot on the warm computer,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,He's just like "I'm trying to help you.",The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,There is another dragon in the cage   the dragon in the video is very very upset and wants to fight the other dragon.  I don't see how this is considered good husbandry  i would never allow my animals to reach that stress level...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,AW I love this so much! Dodo you really made my day!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Why are wild animals being kept as pets? These lizards have a natural habitat they belong in!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Gorgeous and feisty beardie. These are some of the best lizards out there.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,That head bobbing  such cuteness.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

XUBRkPvq3DU,He is so cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Bearded dragon = reptile cat,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Lol,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Doesn't a black beard mean the dragon is upset??,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Love your videos and been here since 300k,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Sneak 100,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,laptop=warm,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,I don't have a bearded dragon  but my cats do this a lot. They like to walk on the keyboard  I'm not sure why.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,Lol the beardie was actually trying to look at the other tank  there was probably another dragon there. You can see the obvious signs of stress  the black beard and the head bobbing. But I can relate  my beardie is constantly on my keyboard for no reason lmao,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
XUBRkPvq3DU,That bearded dragon reminds me of my cat xD,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

-LX0wj2NAAk,Herb Derb. Why can't you have dogs  cats  hamsters  etc  as friends? To me you are saying that human relationships with animals are something that shouldn't happen. I am a vegetarian so I don't eat pigs  cows  chicken  etc. One of my friends has two Potbelly Pigs so she doesn't eat them either and they ARE her pets. My neice has a cow and two horses that are her PETS. I don't know what your idea of a pet is  but if you're saying that dogs should be ground and added to sausage ingredients for human consumption  then sir  you are a Troll. Sites like these are for showing people saving pets from certain death. If you think a dog like this should be made into sausage  you're sick and you're in the wrong place. Now go away PERMANENTLY!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-LX0wj2NAAk,He isn't  in all honesty  a cutie  the li'l sweetheart is ugly as Heck but what he is is completely adorable cos his awesome  joyous  indefatigable personality shines through 100watt bright. ;o),The Dodo,TheDodoSite

Ps6xRFJ5c00,I LOVE this story! He gets to be the puppy he is and in doing so he brings happiness to his fellow canines and human! So glad he gets to end his days like this.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
Ps6xRFJ5c00,Is there no way to treat kidney disease?  There's wats for humans  right  so what about dogs?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

Ps6xRFJ5c00,Fantastic lovely doggie,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
Ps6xRFJ5c00,This is something all senior dogs should have available and hope more facilities will be there for deserving old buddies. it' really so sad that even with todays Science & it's Technology we can't find cures for these kinds of kidney and other organ failures before they happen! Vets are very unreliable people they over vaccinate dogs at a very young age so that they end up dying before their time  and that is a WELL KNOW FACT. It's all a money making industry sad to but true. Nothing they really need and would need gets done at all. It's shameful and disgraceful and the ones who are the ones who are suppose to care really DONT. I did my research on YouTube and googled it. Please DO NOT Vaccinate your beloved more every year its the biggest mistake you'll ever do! Look it up.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

Ps6xRFJ5c00,There's almost no rejection issues among the canines  and most dogs have 2 kidneys  so why is kidney transplantation not an option for doggies???  In theory  it should be easier humans!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
Ps6xRFJ5c00,Thank you for giving these senior dogs a wonderful retirement home - and especially thank you for taking in the puppy  Trigger.  I was shocked when you said  "for the time he has left" - I thought  "what?!"  Trigger looks very healthy  so even though it sounds like he's terminal  I'm glad he's enjoying the time he has  so much.  He does look like such a special dog  because I can see he does react very well to the dogs around him.  He also looks really popular with the other dogs - so it's so sweet.  I hope Trigger defies the doctors predictions and lives happily  much longer than expected!  He is a real charmer and a real cutie.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

And not only that  how about giving you only one seed at the time  waiting for you to swallow it  b4 giving you a second. Would you like that?!?! when you starving... That is what you are doing to them. You cannot take care of them properly  there are several REAL sanctuaries across the US that would love to take care of them. If I were you  I'd start contacting them  have them pay you expenses and take care of the transfer of these poor animals. And look at the cages. They are more like racoon (lol) type of cages.

kFdaV9qju9Q,The thing about aggressive breeds is that they aren't aggressive all the time. When they're under supervision and raised properly  they're just fine. The problem comes when people think they can leave the dogs alone with other small  vulnerable animals. Dogs like this were bred to kill smaller things than them. You can't forget that.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

kFdaV9qju9Q,You have a beautiful family! Thanks for sharing.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
kFdaV9qju9Q,Just goes to show pits aren't nasty beasts  but we have the same problem here in Ireland and the UK with English pitbulls they have a bad name due to people making them fight and  mistreating them  I had a English pit a few years ago one of the best dogs I ever had Kobe he was called sandy brown with a white chest and a white stripe down the front of his face unfortunately he passed away at age 15 which I guess is a pretty good life.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

Alice would come up to Bella's cage and they would smell each other and back away from each other and would sniff each other again. It was like a little game to them. When I would take Bella out  Alice would wag her tail around.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
kFdaV9qju9Q,Everyone thinks pitbulls are dangerous. More and More are proving them wrong.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
kFdaV9qju9Q,Pitbulls and guinea pigs are oddly similar.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

xX66kG8QOcw,Not a pitbull. Media is spreading lies.  A true pitbull a fullblooded American Pitbull Terrier APBT could not live in a house full of other dogs. Say it with me this is not a pitbull. For any dog you just find on the street you just don't assume it is a pure breed. APBTs are Terriers leading to a SLIM body and square head. At max a male pit will weigh at least 40 pounds Please stop spreading lies!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

0Q0uD1GSH8E,Awww,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
0Q0uD1GSH8E,I think people should have to have a permit to breed animals. Proof of vet care and yearly check ins for living conditions required. Add into that some kind of "no pets" registry for those who abuse and neglect animals and we'd have shelters nearly empty. Better yet  with only responsible breeders around self-righteous jerks wouldn't feel the need to harass people who want a specific breed of dog or cat instead of a shelter mutt. A lot of breeds are dying out because people are pushing mutt adoption so hard. The Skye Terrier is now considered extinct. Nobody will ever see another of those big floods because people want to police animal lovers instead of animal abusers.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

pAtJM_HQmJE,Is Alaska currently on a monthly flea and tick preventative? If not  please for Alaska's well-being I highly recommend to put her on a monthly flea and tick preventative. There are flea and tick preventative combination's. Consult your primary Veterinarian for which product best fits for convenience and budget.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pAtJM_HQmJE,Dang Alaska..... You can fish better than me.....,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

CZRGH8TRDJY,I wish more pet owners who clearly love their furkids would exercise a little common sense/restraint and not drive with them in their laps. It only takes one startled jump to cause an accident  or when involved in an accident that's another driver's fault  when the airbag goes off  your pet is probably going to be killed. Or maybe you killed someone else or even yourself because you lost control of your car when your pet freaked out at something.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

ZbHKX5I_zqI,I wish people would stop breeding brachycephalic dogs...it's cruel and selfish. These dogs are pretty much born to suffer and end up crippled. Their owners can go on deluding themselves that they are happy and healthy  but the reality is that they suffer from a slew of serious issues and can't breathe properly  to the point where they cannot even have proper exercise because it could cause respiratory failure :/ How people find this cute is beyond me. Suffering isn't cute.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

ZbHKX5I_zqI,I have a French Bulldog mixed with Keeshond  so he has all the attributes of Boscoe  but a longer snout. He does all the things Daniel described. He's chill  then he's feisty  and I can't even say the mailman's name anymore without getting barking. It's fun to just watch him sometimes.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

okZIMfcqnj4,HEY WHO EVER THAT THROW TRASH INTO THE OCEAN      HOW COULD YOU????????,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Sadly to say  polluting the environment is in the nature of most people. Even with education  and thoroughly knowing the consequences of an action  they still do it. A great example is in a gatherings of people  after the event we can always see trashes everywhere.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Why some of humans have to do that? Like....Mother Mature gave us so many important things and we just destroy them instead of thanking her,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Get rid of plastic bags! Little by little their making stores charge for them and we now bring reusable bags but it should be stopped all together cause people can still buy plastic bags,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Why would they dumb garbage in the ocean why not in lava,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,This is painful to watch,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,if we found a better alternative to plastic bags. then we would decrease plastic pollution so much.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Oops ive come to a sad video welp to late i already watched it :(,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Please let's all do our part   this is heartbreaking  remember all the animals in our oceans need protecting too.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,yeah you could throw your plastic bags and bottles away or you could turn them into plant pots or something like that,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,i LOATHE people who litter!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,All about inspiration to help the world he a good person      Read more,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Padang - west sumatera.hope someone help me to prevent plastics take over the sea. I dont have mucb power to clean and prevent all those plastics,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,THERE A MAD MAN THE GOVERMENT NEED TO STOP THROWING TRASH IN THE OECAN,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,This seriously needs to stop the poor animals!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Im glad that most of the people on our planet would rather succeed in the moment and find convenient/cheap remedies to their problems rather than take the time to recycle their trash and work on saving our planet as a whole  as a 17 year old I am honestly pain stricken by this video  once I am old and retired in the time of my life when I should be relaxing  the reality is that most of us will probably be struggling to survive among overpopulation and over pollution of our earth. All animals before us have naturally sustained a healthy population  while we rapidly spin out of control with over population which is inevitably leading to the death of our planet. I remember when earth day used to be about planting trees  not being saddened by the reality we live in. We are losing our home people. And unless you all open your eyes many of us will be suffering along with our earth in the future.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,I hate humans,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,Aww I will do everything I can to help,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,What have we done to this world?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,lets go Green...!!from now..!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,so the politicians and corporations create all this crap but they want us to worry about it?  I'll tell you... when they start paying me to return their crap  that i never asked them to create in the first place  I'll start worrying about where it ends up.  i think a fair price would be the amount that they charge us for all the packaging/advertising.  and lets not even talk about the built in obsolescence that almost every product manufacturer in the world builds into just about every product we buy assuring that we'll need a new one right about the time the warranty runs out.  the only thing "green" about any of this bullshit is the money changing hands between the corporations and the politicians and all the other bottom feeders that fleece money off us in the name of "green".   the "box" has been opened and there is no going back.  no one on this planet is willing to give up anything they have or want... including the assholes that made this propaganda.  if the politicians and corporations are that concerned about it let them clean it up... at their own expense.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
okZIMfcqnj4,This makes me sick! We are doing this!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

okZIMfcqnj4,Tax on Land fill site infills is an incentive to save money by dumping waste in the ocean. It takes a certain type of mentality to throw plastic rubbish into the neighbouring verges of roads. A remedy is to manufacture only the kind of plastic that after use can become fuel in power stations to generate electricity.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

2KOQinwAzb4,In that last video with the cat stuck in the bathroom wall... the best tool to use would have been a hammer drill with a chisel bit. I used to work in tool rental for about 3.5 years and that is the best idea I have short of a pneumatic hammer tool.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
2KOQinwAzb4,That poor cat in the second video (#4) - - I'm very familiar with that behavior  that poor cat is not getting proper attention at home. That is the action of a cat that is incredibly dissatisfied with their treatment.   If anyone has a cat like that  *at the very minimum * dedicate 10 minutes a day to engaging the cat in play - NOT 'playing with the cat'  it cannot be in any way about you  just dedicate 10 minutes purely to the cat's benefit - do not try and make them do anything cute  just 10 minutes purely for the cat  not for you. Your only task is to have the cat be focused and active on something that is not you.  This will not solve all the problems  but it will greatly reduce them. If you want to properly solve your animal problems  you need to respect your animal and pay attention to what they're telling you  and avoid like the plague the 'storytelling' that many owners fall into. Respect the animal  not your story about the animal.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
2KOQinwAzb4,Wish all the cats are lucky like them...God save them all...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

I respect and talk to her as if she is a friend and for that she respects me back as a friend and does not give me a hard time. sometimes she argues  wants to go the other way  back to where the park is  but at the end she does not do what i dont want her to do. animals are much smarter as we give them credit                for,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

olr5WxrJpSg,That lioness reuniting with her Pride was beautiful! Thank You DoDo for sharing this wonderful video!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,They could not have chosen better clips to illustrate these reunions. Brilliant.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

olr5WxrJpSg,i freaking love animals !!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,The monkey reunion and them hugging got me into tears,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Beautiful,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Animals  like us  are PERSONS  not "things."  Their families recognize the missing family member as "someONE " not someTHING.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,the Lord God is a truly amazing Creator! Praised be the Lord Jesus Christ !,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,If weeks and months are a lot for humans imagine for all these animals that barely live 10 or 20 years. For them is like a whole eternity waiting for their members to reunite again.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,How absolutely adorable!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Sweet,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,I don't know how any human can watch a video like this (animals being reunited with family and friends) and still say that animals don't have feelings.  It makes cruelty even more senseless.  Animals show love  fear  compassion (frequently more than humans)  feel pain  anxiety and every other emotion that humans also have.  Great video.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Why am I crying?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,True friendship  better than human,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,There is so much we can learn about love from animals,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,The monkey at the end is heartwarming!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,So touching that the monkey pulled the other monkey up when he was climbing. That was just warming. Also the lion pride with their missing member.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,So touching my heart could burst in pieces omgosh,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,omg the monkey one was so cute  how his family hugged him >w<,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Proof that animals are capable of love!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,This channel and video are amazing,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,i lost my cat last year for an infection and if he will able to come back home i..............i will hug him sooo hard but.......i cant do that:( i miss u litle boy come back homee!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,the last one was so adorable that monkey hug!!!:))),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Lovely .,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Aww so sweet,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Awe all of these beautiful animals make me happy,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Wonderful love,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Exceptional reunions  thank you!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Wonderful! No words to describe this...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Animals have no soul  huh ????!!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,The lioness was simply trying to call out and listen for a reply from her pride it wasn't crying. unlike males  female lions live their entire lives in the pride she was born into its  instinct to be with them. You personify wild animals too much.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,These aren't tears in my eyes! I don't know what you're talking about! X),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Precious. Just precious,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,The monkeys were adorable! Especially how they pulled the other one up and had a group hug.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,No life without family .. ..human should learn.....sucsess or sorrow....family is the reason to live...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,I really was amazed at the lions pride reunion - I never knew they had that amount of "connectedness"  so it was particularly heart warming. OTH I knew that swans mate for life but  nevertheless  it was so touching to see their reunion.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,Adorable,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,What's that white bird called again?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,How have I not sub to this channel? New sub,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,My favorite ones were the lion + the monkey but that dog one was pretty sweet. They were so excited!! Does anybody know what breed of dog that brown one was? Labradoodle?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
olr5WxrJpSg,That lioness was lucky. Not all prides will accept members back  once they have been separated from them for a while. Maybe because it was a small pride and there were a lot of younger members  that she was immediately accepted back into the pride? Either way  a fantastic outcome!

zJBDOxVbYnA,Thank you for helping these dogs.However  those in Puerto Rico who claim too love dogs need to immediately get involved to stop this insanity. Spay/neuter  make strict laws for owners etc.-we have too many here getting murdered daily in every pound nycacc to start. Meanwhile while our Innocents die Puerto  Ricans are creating thousands of dogs through idiocy and irresponsible behavior that we end up taking causing more of our own to die. Anyone who rescues will understand my comment  if you don't  look up the problem of thousands of dogs on Puerto Rico beaches how owners drown them by throwing in the river  etc.You are damn right I am pissed off.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

AOMSDd83fLU,We are all just softies when it comes to animals. Darn it!!!!!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,My neighbors rescued a squirrel.  It became the terror of the neighborhood. It had no fear of anything. Would get into houses and trash them. Would attack people walking by if they didn't feed it. They tried turning it loose in the park in the neighborhood. It came back and destroyed their screen windows to get in the house. If I ever come across an orphan squirrel. I would definitely rescue it. It it would go to a rescue organizations that are equipped to deal with them. This squirrel eventually got run over. Since it regularly rode in their car. It also had no fear of cars... I was kinda relieved when it got run over.  Hate to say that. But it's true...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,Alicia! COOL!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

AOMSDd83fLU,A former professor of mine looked EXACTLY like Hagrid from Harry Potter.  He would sit outside and all the squirrels and birds would crawl on him as he fed them.  Squirrels really are awesome.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,dunno what i like more that squirrel or the tapestry hanging on the wall.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,tiny?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,That is an alpha if I've ever seen one,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,They have a brain less than a dumb dog and people interpret stupidity to cute  probably she(squirrel) doesn't know what she(squirrel) is doing because animal only know how to eat in whole video she is eating and doesn't know what the owner describe as I say don't take stupidity to cute.People go crazy about their pets but in reality in their mind  hungry-food-sleep-hungry-food-sleep and some time some humphiiiiiinnnnnng.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

AOMSDd83fLU,She is so fat,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,You might be describing yourself.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,Whats up with squirrels and avocados,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,Can she still be safely released considering she was hand raised? I assumed Misa was a permanent resident considering she has the run of the house and so much contact with the person caring for her. Won't she be in danger from cats  dogs and humans now that she isn't afraid of them? I don't know much about rehabbing squirrels  but it seems counterproductive to tame them and then expect them to live like a wild animal without assistance or protection. Otherwise  this was a very fun video to watch  just can't help being concerned. I hope for her sake I'm completely wrong.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
AOMSDd83fLU,Sooooooooo adorably cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

L5Ynv9ocJwo,This is another example of the Love of God. Anyone who comes to the aid of anyone or animal in distress or pain has the Love of God in them. God gives life and more abundantly. God is LOVE. God so loved the world  he gave his only son Jesus to die for our sins that whosoever believes in him will never die but have everlasting life in Heaven. Jesus is the Truth  the life and the way. The ONLY way to Heaven. If you know the Truth  it will set you free from the bondage of Satan. Satan kills steals and destroys. Satan is a Liar and Deceiver. Satan is filthy and nasty. Jesus defeated Satan at the Cross. Repent and receive Jesus as your Savior. Make the right choice. I Did. You have nothing to lose. Jesus is Lord.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

-2x-zbeA9c0,Hey  Dodo Congrats On Your New Show On Animal Planet! Im Very Excited To See It!   OMG Thanks For The Heart!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-2x-zbeA9c0,Poor dogs! Why do people don't understand they are not humans. Why do they have to cut their fur like that? Anyway we still don't understand.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-2x-zbeA9c0,This is the mentality of these people who live in the Upper East and West Side of NYC. They need purebred dogs  usually small in size  to make a fashion statement. This materialistic yuppie princess couldn't find it in her heart to visit a local shelter  which kills many dogs on a daily basis  and rescue a dog?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-2x-zbeA9c0,I love goldendoodles and labradoodles  both are amazing breeds,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-2x-zbeA9c0,So cute!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
-2x-zbeA9c0,If you drive more than 2-3 hours you have allready decided before you started,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

hZxARR-mYvQ,Omg! So lovely! She is so lucky to have that lovely suprise! :3,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

hZxARR-mYvQ,If you're one of the people who dislike this video go f*** yourself this was adorable AF,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,is she crying??? what a....       DOG LOVER/AMAZING PERSON! WOOOOO!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,I seen this video from another person,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,When she cried  I cried.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,Can she bend down to pick his poop off the carpet?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,I thought she was pregnant,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,Did anybody else almost cry,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,This kind of videos are cute and everything  but tbh if I was ready to adopt an animal again  I'd prefer to choose it myself at the shelter rather than have someone handing me one. I just feel like the first contact with an animal in a shelter  you can already tell if you're going to connect with them or not.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,*Awwww!*,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,So cute!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,Yorkies are basically the PERFECT family dog... They have the energy to play with younger children  will cuddle with the older family members  and will fiercely protect babies... They also get along pretty well with a variety of different animals...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,I dont who's more adorable the dog or grandma. She is so sweet. So is grandpa,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,My heart just melted! This is so sweet! I wish I could have a dog...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

hZxARR-mYvQ,What a sweetie <3 and I mean the Grammie!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,That pup is in for the good life!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,This is exactly why we need chihuahua and Yorkshire  those dogs that people are so happy to call "rats" and hate on. We need them for our grandmas  granddads  and young children,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,aaw that's adorable!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,I'd be speechless too.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,So cuteeeee !!!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,Cute doggie... but can someone explain those clue gifts in reference to pup.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,Sorry  not a fan of this idea. An elderly couple and not in good shape either. I feel sorry for young dogs being forced to slowly walk on a leash with their elderly owners .They are not allowed to walk faster let alone run. Sometimes they do not go outside at all and have to use litter boxes.  In all likelihood this woman is going to pass away before her dog and Archie's going to suffer immensely.   I also hope that the family members filming this are fully prepared to take the dog in when this happens. So many dogs end up in shelters because the family does not want to care for their deceased relative's dog. The dodo has even shown an extreme case with one dog starving almost to death because the owner died and it was left to its fate by ''the family'.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
hZxARR-mYvQ,I love it  . Thanks dodo for sharing this beautiful video with us,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

cQ_PlD_0zDo,the over dramatic voice over and music is so unnecessary and long . maybe if it was shorter I'd find it bearable   but all i kept hearing throughout the first two minutes of the video was "starfish was so strong.

(45 min) This was about 16 hours after first seeing me. I had a heart attack I was unaware of  but she knew I needed help. I calmed down and began to breathe a lot easier.

EZAdRW5w_sA,THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY FOR SAVING THE LITTLE GUY'S LIFE.  IN THE STATE WHERE I LIVE  THEY SEE DOGS AS PROPERTY.  HAS EVERYONE EVER HEARD OF BUILDING A HOUSE ON A DOG  MOVING YOUR FURNITURE IN AND RAISING A FAMILY ON A DOG? MY LIFE DEPENDS ON WHAT MY ADA SERVICE DOG IS ABLE TO DO FOR ME.  HE'S RETIREMENT AGE AND IT TAKES 3 YEARS TO FULLY TRAIN AN ADA SERVICE DOG FOR ALL OF MY SPECIAL NEEDS. SINCE I HAVE BEEN TRAINING DOGS FOR OVER 50 YEARS I TRAIN THEM UNDER THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE ADA  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. TO THIS DAY THE STATE  ONE OF THE ORIGINAL UNITED STATES HAS PLACES WHERE THE DISABLED ARE TREATED LIKE CRIMINALS FOR WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY HAVE  VERSUS IN MANY OTHER STATES THIS PROHIBITED BECAUSE THOSE STATES RECOGNIZE FEDERAL SUPERIORITY.  NOT HERE IN NBR. 13. NEW JERSEY.  HOW DO I KNOW THIS? BECAUSE I AM THE ONE THEY CAME AFTER AND THREW IN JAIL  UNDER 2 NAMES AND A PLACE OF BIRTH THAT IS NOT MINE.  SO DOGS MEAN MORE TO ME THAN WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT FOR NATURAL BORN AMERICAN CITIZENS.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

pDni12sktZE,I got my cat at about a year old (she kind of adopt us though when the neighbour abandoned her) and even though I never saw her as a kitten. She is clearly a runt  she is so small even for a female cat. A lot of people don't realise because of her long fur but when you pick her up it's different story. But boy is she a little spitfire!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pDni12sktZE,Tiny but Mighty!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
pDni12sktZE,Well  good for that kitten. I wish other kittens were as lucky. I have this neighbor who has a female cat who just has litter after litter of kittens  the mother doesn't take care of them for long  and the owner just locks them out of the house  there's some more bad stuff about that family but I won't talk about it  it's not relevant anyway.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

bP_rjzpAeVQ,I would like to visit a sanctuary like this one day and play with them on the snow ^-^,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,CUTE,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I like wolves,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Awww,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,In northern Manitoba  Cananda wild wolvs are going into communities eating dogs such as pitbulls to bullmastives,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Awwwwwwwww,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Aww so cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,hi,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Hi,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I'm part wolf but nobody believes me people say it's impossible :( :( :(,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Are the animals prevented from breeding? If so  how?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,This is really  neat. Im so glad to see her want to help them. Have they every bit her?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Had a 7/8th wolf  1/8th GSD  acted almost like any other dog but had her since she was 8 weeks growing up with other dogs  cats  horses and cattle  its mostly proper  early socialization,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I don't like how the woman in this video says it depends on the wolf content instead she should say it depends on the wolf dog. Mostly because my family has owns two different wolf dogs and they have both been completely different from each other. Wolf dogs are just like any other dog you need to treat them with respect and understand that they want the respect that you want and that's how it works.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,What type of license do you have/need for running sanctuary? thank you for your work with these beautiful wolf dogs.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I am the lorax and i speak for the tres          the tres say you must die  (Shoots)  *SANTIAGO*,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Animals will show you that they're  Animals! So Be Easy!  If you're  kind  They're kind! And if you're Mean  "They're Mean!  "Kind of makes me wonder  Are we Really the Humans?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I love both wolves and dogs. I think it is sad that breeders are breeding wolf dogs. I am wondering how many wolf dogs get turned away because the Sanctuary is full? And what happens to them at that point?                                                                                                         A wolf is a beautiful wild animal  they should be left alone in their natural habitats to live life on their own terms. They don't want to be  and shouldn't be "owned" by humans.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,I always miss the live streaming and could kick myself for it! I can see it nowbut cannot ask a question... i grew up with a 90%wolf dog as my neighbour and now  later in life  i always wanted one simply because they are amazing and beautiful and the wolf dog named Merlin as a child was the most well behaved wolf dog who protected his owners as well as ALL children with hs very life... they truely are beautiful inside and out... hopefully  ill catch the next live stream if they come back to this sancutary so i can ask my question! This sanctuary is the best thing out there for these precious animals! God bless you!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
bP_rjzpAeVQ,Shortest live stream ever lol.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

xceCJgwgHFs,Meh want a wolfdog,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,We found a little wolf/husky and she lived 16 glorious years with us and was such a snuggle bug. I miss her every day. Granted each dog mix is different and I was fortunate to have a sweetheart  but temperament can vary from sweet to not so sweet.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

xceCJgwgHFs,that dumb female talking says it all... they want everything every moment ..every second... shut up dumb dumbs ;...stop being such dodo's,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,clams will never let males be the alfa...and they are wrong in so many ways...cause a clam (female) can never ever protect the clan from danger... clams need to learn to not want to have and be everything ..they are not seahorses ...,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,I have got a quarter wolfdog.  She is half malamute   quarter husky and a quarter wolfdog. She is the best that happened in my life.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Been to there before  all the wolves and wolfdogs seem to really love it there. Glad he has a free tknew home now,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Just a p.s there is no alpha the guy that said there is an alpha in a wolf pack about 35 years ago did his own resewrch and 20 years later had to take his book off of the sheoves about alpha wolves and his claim went donw the drain and he found out there was no such thijng as an alpha wolf and he had to admijt to everyone that he was wrong because true researchers that know alot about wolve packs were telling him he was wrong and he finally came out saying thrre is no such thing as an alpha everyone still uses the term when it just isnt true just because one is more dominant doesnt mean they are the alpha there is alot to it do some research on it you will be very surprised but of course people will say yes there is but before that book was written nobody said anything about an alpha that came from a guy that wrote a book about wolves and it has stuck and people still use it like i said do some research on it you will be very surprised,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Stop breeding exotic pets people. It's just not fair not all of them have a happy ending like this.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,We need more people like you guys for sure,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,So  i havent researched these dogs  but are they safe to own? because when they become more "alpha " do they stop listening to commands and/or become more aggressive?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,The most beautiful dog ever !,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Give a PURE feel good sensation to ANY male on species on earth and you will be rewarded by a gracefully alpha look  stand  posture. Let's go Sarge show them you still have ballz motherfucker!!!!,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,One of my spirit animals. Love them so dearly.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Simple law of nature if you give love you'll get unconditional love except for humans .,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Morale of the story. Do NOT get a fucking wolf or wolfdog people just to satisfy your own feelings.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Had one years ago when I was in highschool and if I could afford a pet right now I would try to get another wolfdog.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

xceCJgwgHFs,very sad  to see he has to sleep in a cage,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,Soooo CUTE,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,lot of wolfdogs are being euthinazed becose  deponds how much % is dog and how much is wolf  also russian army use wolfdogs breed,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
xceCJgwgHFs,What people fail to realize is wolf hybrids are not trainable  they are high energy  they will destroy your house  especially if alone  (major separation anxiety)  they will act wild  basically like a wild wolf that has no fear of people. They will hunt your cat/small animal  they will not listen to you  plus all this is amplified if the animal is a high content wolfdog. It will act more like a wild wolf than a dog. Also   they are used to covering MILES when the pack is active during the day. You will need to provide COPIUS amounts of exercise. Every day. They will dig  especially in the Summer heat to keep cool  they will howl  and annoy the neighbors  and they may not see you as the alpha in the pack. Plus  they can get big  I have seen pure wolves get 120+lbs. They will not accept a leash  or behave in public. You have more or less brought a wild animal in the home with a lack of fear from the dog. It will not act like a dog. Or how you want it to  for that matter. It's first desire will be to take care of number one  which may not be you. If you still want a wolfdog  get a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog  or a Saarloos Wolfhound or a purebred dog that looks like a wolf  the Alaskan Noble Companion Dog.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

xceCJgwgHFs,I have wolfdog he is know in my neighborhood was for stealing food in so many creative ways. I remember a couple of months ago he would get on my bed when I am eating a sandwich and he would put his paw in my nuts and when I pulled the sandwich away he dug his nails slightly when I got the sandwich closer he would loosen up. I love him so much he is basically the brother I always wish I had,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

sk6sZHRTFoY,Aww.... hanuman.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,I think it's bullshit that people in the u.s. are having WILD animals as pets. They belong only out in the WILD and if not possible because rich people are taking homes away from the poor animals then the animals need to be in protected sanctuaries. People also need to stop petting and hugging and taming WILD animals. It's stupid.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,Is crying of happiness,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

sk6sZHRTFoY,WOW!!!! :),The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,I'm just curious  Vervets are not endangered  why not use resources on species who are actually endangered? I understand that babies get abandoned sometimes  and this may seem harsh  but is it really necessary or even healthy for the Vervet population to artificially inflate their numbers?,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

sk6sZHRTFoY,How many babies does one foster Mum care for at once????,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,I think that Vetwrap should be used in very limited ways. It is very unforgiving in small animals. It grabs far too much for them and a traditional elastic wrap is far better for the circulation. Vet wrap wraps should not be left on s long as they commonly are done.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,It would be great to connect rescues  like this foundation  with people that have a desire to have a baby monkey as a pet. By volunteering they can fulfill their desire to care for a baby monkey and help an orphan to live a better life at the same time  instead of buying a monkey as a pet.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,awww so cute,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,The wrong thing with these videos is people see these little monkeys and they want them as pets. They aren't pets they're wild monkeys and they should live free,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
sk6sZHRTFoY,It breaks my heart every time I hear of an orphaned infant monkey. They grieve just like human children do.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

IwefUoypbbE,Roman is my hero.  My dream is to have a sanctuary  or be a foster.  All the dogs I've had since 1999 have been rescues.  I want a companion for my little boy  and I really want a special needs rescue.  If I lived where Roman lives  I'd be a part of Project Freedom Ride.  We have nothing like that where I live.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite

IwefUoypbbE,How can we help this kid? Stop buying dogs... Let's adopt... Find his channel on youtube and watch the ads on his video  share the video and encourage others to do the same... Donate money (if you have some spare $1  $5) any amount doesn't matter. My family has adopted few (in totals there are probably 20s dogs + cats - some are grow old and died) and for now we can't afford more but I hope and pray in the future our economy is getting better so we can adopt more. fingers crossed.,The Dodo,TheDodoSite
